# AGENTS.md

Repo guidance for Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, and any developer joining Wander.

## Project Overview

Rec.me, formerly Wander, is a native iOS social map for remembering places worth returning to and discovering places through trusted people.

North Star: when someone needs a place, Wander shows where trusted people have actually been, what they thought, and whether it fits the moment.

Current wedge: trusted people's place memories become a searchable map you can actually use.

Do not reframe this as a lists app, public feed, travel-only app, check-in game, restaurant-only ranking app, or live-location product.

## Required Agent Work Log

All agents working in this repo must keep `docs/agent-log.md` current.

Before non-trivial work:

- Read the latest entries in `docs/agent-log.md`.
- Append a new entry with date/time, agent/tool name, goal, branch, current git status, and files you expect to touch.
- If another agent is already working on overlapping files, call that out before editing.

During work:

- Append meaningful checkpoints for long tasks, roughly every 30 minutes or whenever the plan materially changes.
- Log decisions, assumptions, commands run, test results, blockers, screenshots reviewed, and files changed.
- If you discover dirty worktree changes you did not make, log them and do not revert them.

At handoff or completion:

- Append final outcome, commit hash or PR, tests run, known issues, and concrete next steps.
- If work is incomplete, include exact restart instructions.
- Do not leave important decisions only in chat. Durable project decisions belong in `docs/decisions.md` or `docs/open-questions.md` as appropriate.

This log is coordination infrastructure. Treat it as part of the deliverable.

## Collaboration And Git Workflow

`main` is the integration branch. Do not do non-trivial feature, fix, or release work directly on `main`; use a short-lived branch and open a PR back to `main`.

Branch prefixes:

- `joe/<short-task>` for Joe
- `ryan/<short-task>` for Ryan
- `codex/<short-task>` for Codex
- `claude/<short-task>` for Claude
- `openclaw/<short-task>` for OpenClaw

Prefer a separate worktree for agent implementation when Joe, Ryan, or another agent may also be working locally:

```bash
git worktree add ../Wander-worktrees/<short-task> -b codex/<short-task> origin/main
```

Before editing, agents must run `git fetch origin`, check `git status --short --branch`, and read the latest `docs/agent-log.md` entries. If there are uncommitted or untracked files, assume they belong to Joe, Ryan, or another agent. Do not edit overlapping files without calling out the overlap first.

Avoid parallel edits to high-conflict files unless explicitly coordinated:

- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `docs/agent-log.md`
- Supabase migrations

For non-trivial feature, fix, refactor, release, or docs/process changes, agents must end the session by either:

- Opening or updating a ready PR if the work is complete.
- Opening or updating a draft PR if the work is incomplete.

This applies especially to Ryan-owned work on `ryan/<short-task>` branches. Ryan's agent should push its branch and open or update the PR before stopping without waiting for a separate human prompt, unless Ryan explicitly says not to push or not to open a PR.

Before merging to `main`, update the branch from latest `origin/main`, resolve conflicts, inspect the PR diff for unrelated files or generated junk, run the relevant build/tests, and update `docs/agent-log.md` with outcome, tests, known issues, and next steps. Prefer squash merging PRs into `main`, then delete the branch.

## Tech Stack

- Native iOS, iPhone-first.
- SwiftUI, Swift 6 mode, iOS 17+.
- SwiftData for local persistence and offline-first cache.
- MapKit/CoreLocation for maps and place lookup.
- PhotosUI later for photo capture/import.
- XcodeGen owns project generation through `project.yml`.
- Planned backend: Clerk for identity/account UX, Supabase Postgres/RLS/PostGIS/storage/functions for app data.
- Current M2 implementation uses local seeded data through `WanderStore` and deterministic fakes.

## How To Run Locally

Generate the Xcode project after changing source files or `project.yml`:

```bash
xcodegen generate
```

Build:

```bash
xcodebuild build -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Test:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

If Xcode plugin/CoreSimulator access fails under a sandbox, rerun from a normal terminal or with approved elevated access.

## Architecture

Important folders:

- `Wander/App/` - app entry point and root tab shell.
- `Wander/DesignSystem/` - SwiftUI tokens and shared components.
- `Wander/Features/Map/` - map surface and selected place sheet.
- `Wander/Features/Add/` - current-location/manual/link/photo add flow.
- `Wander/Features/Discover/` - smart filters, search, people/profile lookup.
- `Wander/Features/Profile/` - owner profile, other-user profiles, graph lists.
- `Wander/Features/Settings/` - settings gear surface from Profile.
- `Wander/Models/` - local models, enums, visibility/sync contracts.
- `Wander/Services/` - fixtures, local store, repository/parser/provider protocols.
- `WanderTests/` - unit and contract tests.
- `preview/follow-profile-settings-mocks/` - approved visual handoff source.
- `docs/` - spec, plans, decisions, handoff, setup, reviews, agent log.

Core rules:

- Views must not call Clerk or Supabase directly. Use repository/protocol boundaries.
- Supabase RLS is authoritative for social visibility; client visibility policy is UI-only.
- Four bottom tabs only: Map, Add, Discover, Profile. Settings opens from Profile gear.
- `project.yml` is the Xcode source of truth. Regenerate with XcodeGen instead of hand-editing project membership.
- Link/photo capture in M2 is an honest unresolved-draft shell until backend extraction jobs exist.
- Native Contacts permission is planned later; M2 uses `FakeContactProvider` plus username search.

## Current Priorities

1. Fix M2 visual QA issues on real simulator sizes, starting with Map screen scale/orientation/safe areas.
2. Keep M2 local loop working: map, add, discover, profile, settings, follow/unfollow/block, visibility, drafts.
3. Move next to M3 only after the UI baseline is acceptable: Clerk + Supabase schema/RLS foundation.
4. Preserve docs as source of truth for new contributors: start with `docs/codex-handoff.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and `docs/decisions.md`.

## Known Issues And Gotchas

- The first native M2 UI pass is functionally wired but visually poor on simulator screenshots: map content appears undersized/letterboxed and controls are oversized/crowded. Treat this as the active UI bug.
- `preview/follow-profile-settings-mocks/` is the approved visual baseline. Do not generate a competing design direction unless Joe explicitly asks.
- Existing handoff mocks are a reference, not production code. Recreate the intent natively in SwiftUI.
- UI copy says Everyone/Friends/Self, but backend values are `followers`/`mutuals`/`self`. "Everyone" means followers-visible in v0.1, not the public internet.
- Follow graph is one-way follows; friends are mutual follows.
- Blocks are hard blocks: blocked users should disappear from search, lists, profiles, map results, and stale views.
- There may be local Xcode signing/team edits in `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` from opening the project. Do not commit project signing churn unless intentional.

## Style Rules

- Follow `DESIGN.md` before changing UI.
- Promote visual tokens from `preview/follow-profile-settings-mocks/tokens.css` into SwiftUI tokens 1:1.
- Warm, map-first, playful utility. Avoid sterile SaaS, generic travel blue, influencer-feed language, or all-beige drift.
- Use SF Symbols/native controls where appropriate. Emoji may appear in category/question affordances only if accessible and not structural.
- Respect safe areas, Dynamic Type, 44pt minimum tap targets, keyboard, and the home indicator.
- iPhone-first. Do not stretch phone UI into desktop/iPad layouts without a specific side-panel plan.

## Testing Rules

- Every milestone should land with matching tests.
- Run the full `xcodebuild test` command above before committing implementation changes.
- Current important test coverage:
  - design tokens
  - four-tab navigation contract
  - visibility policy
  - sync state machine
  - deterministic Discover parser
  - local store follow/block/search/save/draft behavior
- For visual work, also capture simulator screenshots across at least the current iPhone target and one smaller phone target before calling the UI ready.

## App Store Build Numbers

Default assumption: every app-code merge to `main` is a TestFlight candidate unless Joe explicitly says it is not. After merging app-code, UI, schema, testable behavior, or QA-relevant changes into `main`, immediately create a follow-up build-number commit, archive/upload that build, and only then post a tester-facing Slack note. Do not wait for a separate reminder.

Any `main` update that is intended to ship to App Store Connect or TestFlight must increment the App Store build number before upload. Do not reuse a build number for the same marketing version; App Store Connect requires monotonically increasing build numbers.

Required release workflow:

- Merge the implementation PR to `main`.
- Increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.yml`.
- Run `xcodegen generate` so `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` reflects the new build number.
- Commit and push both `project.yml` and `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` to `main`.
- Run the relevant `xcodebuild` build/test command after regenerating the project.
- Archive and upload the binary with that incremented build number.
- Set/confirm export compliance and attach the uploaded build to the public TestFlight group when applicable.
- Update `docs/agent-log.md` with the build number, commit hash, tests run, archive path, upload status, TestFlight status, and known issues.
- Only after archive/upload has completed should an agent post a tester-facing Slack note. If the binary is still processing or not yet externally approved, the Slack note must say that plainly.
- If the build is attached to TestFlight or confirmed available, follow the Slack release-note rules below and state the live/approved status.

Docs-only or process-only commits to `main` do not need a build-number bump unless they are being packaged into a new TestFlight/App Store build. If an agent intentionally skips the bump for a `main` update, note that in `docs/agent-log.md`.

## TestFlight Release Notes

Whenever an agent uploads a new TestFlight build, attaches it to the public group, or confirms it is available for testing, the agent must also post a short release note to the rec.me Slack feedback channel:

- Slack channel: `#testflight-feedback`
- Slack channel ID: `C0BAA7DG2AC`
- Public TestFlight link: `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`

The Slack note must include:

- App name `rec.me`, the build number, and whether the build is live/approved or still processing.
- What changed, written for testers rather than engineers.
- What needs testing, as a concrete checklist.
- Known issues or intentionally deferred areas.
- A request to reply in-thread with device, account/email if relevant, screenshots, and exact repro steps.

For broad announcements only, `#all-recme` (`C0B9FU1QNG2`) exists, but TestFlight feedback prompts belong in `#testflight-feedback`.
