## Current Direction

- Map-first iOS app
- Follow graph, with mutual follows treated as friends
- Visibility states: Everyone, Friends, Self
- Four tabs: Map, Add, Discover, Profile
- Profile merges personal place memory with public/self profile
- Settings as a gear from Profile
- Contacts and username search for finding people
- Contextual add flows by category

## Development

`project.yml` is the Xcode project source of truth.

Generate the Xcode project:

```bash
xcodegen generate
```

Build:

```bash
xcodebuild build -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Test:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```
