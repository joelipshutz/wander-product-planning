# Agent Log

This is the shared work log for all agents and developers working in this repo.

Rules:

- Add an entry before non-trivial work starts.
- Add checkpoints during long work or when direction changes.
- Add a completion/handoff entry with tests, commits, known issues, and next steps.
- Mention dirty worktree changes you did not make. Do not revert them without explicit instruction.
- Keep entries concrete enough that another agent can resume without reading the whole chat.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex - Morning Reset, M2 Local Loop, Handoff Docs

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Status at start of this log entry: local `main` matched `origin/main` at `962efce`, with one uncommitted Xcode project signing/team diff in `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.

### What Happened

- Joe asked to audit/reset earlier low-pass implementation work and redo from a stronger plan.
- Low-pass native implementation was reset in commit `c3ac87f`.
- Audited plan/docs were locked in:
  - `7f12630 docs: lock reset audit contract`
  - `7edbea2 docs: complete m2 design gate`
- Rebuilt the native foundation and M2 local product loop:
  - `3b109ad feat: rebuild audited ios foundation`
  - `962efce feat: build local m2 product loop`
- Pushed `962efce` to GitHub `main`.
- Verified with `xcodebuild test`; latest successful run had 18 tests and 0 failures.

### M2 Implementation Summary

Built locally with deterministic fixtures:

- Four tabs: Map, Add, Discover, Profile.
- Settings from Profile gear only.
- MapKit map with seeded own/social pins and filters.
- Add flow with current-location/manual save, visibility picker, contextual questions, and honest link/photo unresolved drafts.
- Discover with smart filters, username/profile lookup, contacts-shaped UI, and social save.
- Profile/settings with follow/unfollow/block, followers/following lists, default visibility, blocked users, drafts, and local sync hints.
- `WanderStore` manages seeded local state, visibility filtering, follow/block behavior, discover parsing, drafts, and saves.

### Tests Run

Known successful command:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Result:

```text
18 tests, 0 failures
```

Coverage includes token values, tab navigation, visibility policy, sync state transitions, deterministic Discover parser, save merge behavior, drafts, profile search, block behavior, current-location metadata, and graph edge lists.

### Current Known Issue

Joe shared a simulator screenshot showing the M2 Map screen looks bad:

- App content is undersized/letterboxed inside the iPhone simulator.
- Map does not fill and orient naturally to the device screen.
- Search, chips, selected place sheet, and tab bar are too large/crowded.
- Bottom sheet and tab bar compete for vertical space.

Next implementation task: fix root/Map layout sizing and safe areas first, then sweep Add/Discover/Profile/Settings.

### Dirty Worktree Caveat

There is an uncommitted generated Xcode project diff:

- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Observed contents look like local Xcode signing/team churn, including `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Y7TVK75RZ8` and an `explicitFileType` change for `Wander.app`.

Do not include this in docs or UI commits unless Joe explicitly wants local signing settings committed.

### Token/Usage Sketch For The Morning

Exact token/billing usage is not visible inside the repo or terminal. Qualitatively, the morning spent a lot of context on:

- Reconstructing product decisions from the long thread.
- Running plan/design/engineering review workflows and writing durable specs.
- Rebuilding the native SwiftUI app foundation.
- Implementing the M2 local product loop across Map, Add, Discover, Profile, Settings, models, services, and tests.
- Iterating through Xcode build/test failures and long compiler logs.
- Verifying GitHub `main` and pushing commits.
- Diagnosing the simulator screenshot and creating this catch-up/handoff package.

The highest-token sinks were likely long repository/document reads, Swift/Xcode build output, multi-file diffs, and the large planning/spec context.

### Disk Space Note

While creating this handoff, the machine had only about 100 MB free on `/System/Volumes/Data`. Clearing generated Xcode build artifacts freed enough space:

- Removed repo-local `DerivedData`.
- Cleared global Xcode DerivedData cache under `/Users/joelipshutz/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`.

These were generated build caches, not source files.

### Next Steps

1. Commit the handoff docs and agent log rules.
2. Fix M2 native UI sizing/layout, starting with Map/root safe-area behavior.
3. Run build/tests.
4. Capture simulator screenshots if possible.
5. Commit and push the visual fix.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex - M2 Native UI Sizing Fix

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `c452297`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has an unstaged local signing/team diff that should remain untouched unless Joe asks.

Goal: fix the simulator screenshot failure where the M2 Map UI is letterboxed/undersized and controls are crowded. Start by inspecting app/root launch configuration, safe-area handling, and Map screen layout. Then patch the smallest stable surface, run tests, capture screenshots if possible, commit, and push.

Expected files to inspect/touch:

- `Wander/Resources/Info.plist`
- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/DesignSystem/WanderTheme.swift`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- `Wander/Resources/Info.plist` had no launch-screen declaration. Added `UILaunchScreen` and portrait orientation, which should remove iOS compatibility letterboxing on modern simulators.
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift` was tightened for native scale: full-screen map ignores safe areas, smaller search bar, smaller map filter chips, smaller pins, and a more compact selected place sheet.

Completion checkpoint, 2026-06-01 11:28 PDT:

- Ran the full test suite after the sizing patch:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

- Result: 18 tests, 0 failures.
- Captured simulator screenshots:
  - `DerivedData/wander-map-after-final-iphone16plus.png`
  - `DerivedData/wander-map-after-final-iphone16e.png`
- Visual result: the iOS letterboxing/undersized app frame is fixed on both targets. Map now fills the screen. Search, chips, pins, and selected-place sheet are materially more compact. On smaller phones the filter chips remain horizontally scrollable by design.
- Remaining local caveat: `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has an unstaged local signing/team diff that was not part of this work and should remain uncommitted unless Joe explicitly wants it.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex - M2.1 Visual QA Sweep

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `32e3edc`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: sweep the remaining M2 native screens after the Map letterboxing fix. Capture/navigate Add, Discover, Profile, Settings, and related profile/list/draft states where practical; patch obvious sizing, safe-area, truncation, and density issues; run tests; commit and push.

Expected files to inspect/touch:

- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Profile/ProfileScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Settings/SettingsScreen.swift`
- `Wander/DesignSystem/WanderTheme.swift`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion checkpoint, 2026-06-01 15:28 PDT:

- Added QA launch arguments in `WanderRootView`:
  - `-WanderInitialTab add|discover|profile`
  - `-WanderOpenSettings`
- Compact visual sweep:
  - Add: reduced row/card height, icon size, header/subtitle scale, and draft/saved state bulk.
  - Discover: reduced header/search density, people card height, smart-filter height, and place-row padding.
  - Profile: reduced owner card, stat tiles, month card, empty rows, and recent rows.
  - Settings: reduced row/card density and fixed visibility/blocked cards shrinking to content width.
- Captured screenshots under `DerivedData/visual-sweep/`:
  - iPhone 16 Plus: Add, Discover, Profile, Settings.
  - iPhone 16e: Add, Discover, Profile, Settings.
- Visual result: no iOS letterboxing, no obvious clipping, no tab-bar overlap on reviewed first-view screens. Discover remains the densest screen but now shows the first result fully and the second result partially on iPhone 16e.
- Ran full test suite:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

- Result: 20 tests, 0 failures.
- Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.01_15-29-13--0700.xcresult`.
- Remaining local caveat: `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has the unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted unless Joe asks.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - M2 Interaction Punch List

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `0d861f0`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: finish the M2 acceptance punch list Joe approved: Discover keyboard swipe dismissal, basic Map search, Discover places section with an embedded 3-stage `my`/`friends`/`everyone` switch, and Profile people section with the same 3-stage switch for `following`/`followers`/`friends`.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/DesignSystem/WanderTheme.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Profile/ProfileScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/DiscoverModels.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `WanderTests/WanderStoreTests.swift`
- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- Joe added Map selected-place details feedback mid-pass.
- Discover:
  - Added `.scrollDismissesKeyboard(.interactively)`.
  - Moved source scope into the Places section as a 3-way `mine` / `friends` / `everyone` segmented switch.
  - Default Discover scope is now `everyone` under current follow/privacy visibility rules.
- Profile:
  - Reworked the people section into a 3-way `following` / `followers` / `friends` switch with inline rows.
- Map:
  - Added local search over visible place name/category/locality/owner/note/rating.
  - Removed the custom marker title pill so MapKit's outside annotation title is the only place label.
  - Changed selected place sheet expansion from tap-on-handle to vertical swipe/drag.
  - Added expanded sheet answer/detail chips from current local fixture fields because M2 does not yet persist Add-flow `LocalPlaceAttribute` answers.
- During final verification, found a transient dirty typo in `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift` (`_initialPresentation` name mangled). Restored it to committed content; no RootView diff remains.
- Tests:
  - Initial sandboxed `xcodebuild test` could not access CoreSimulator; reran with approved elevated simulator access.
  - Final command: `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
  - Result: 22 tests, 0 failures.
  - Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.02_12-56-11--0700.xcresult`.
- No screenshots captured for this pass; Joe said he would test and wanted push/merge first.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - Persist Add Question Answers

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `eba2c70`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: wire Add-flow contextual question answers into `LocalPlaceAttribute`, show those persisted answers in the expanded Map place sheet, commit/push, then continue into M3 backend foundation.

Current question source:

- Code currently has starter blocks: `how's the vibe?`, `good for working?`, and `tags`.
- Spec defines category templates but does not enumerate all options. Implementing starter category-aware templates now:
  - Coffee: rating, work setup, coffee tags.
  - Hike: rating, strenuousness, hike tags.
  - Restaurant: rating, price, occasion, restaurant tags.
  - Bar/park/default: rating plus lightweight category tags.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Models/LocalModels.swift`
- `Wander/Services/RepositoryProtocols.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderFixtures.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `WanderTests/WanderStoreTests.swift`
- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion checkpoint:

- Added category-aware Add question templates while keeping answer persistence open-ended for future custom/user-created questions.
  - Coffee: rating/excitement, work setup, tags.
  - Hike: rating/excitement, strenuousness, tags.
  - Restaurant: rating/excitement, price, occasion, tags.
  - Bar/park/default: rating/excitement plus lightweight category tags.
- Added `PlaceAttributeDraft` and store-level `placeAttributes` state.
- `saveCandidate` now accepts optional answer attributes:
  - Add details passes attributes and persists them.
  - Existing callers that omit attributes preserve existing answers instead of wiping them.
  - Explicitly provided attributes replace the old answer set for that saved place.
- Seeded Woodcat, Griffith, and Larchmont with real `LocalPlaceAttribute` rows.
- Expanded Map place sheet now reads persisted attributes instead of category-derived placeholder chips.
- Social saves copy source place attributes into the saved place.
- `pendingSyncCount` now includes unsynced attributes.
- Locked the flexible-answer/custom-question decision in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Tests:
  - First run failed on a missing `return` in `saveVisiblePlace` after adding copied attributes; fixed.
  - Final command: `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
  - Result: 24 tests, 0 failures.
  - Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.02_13-12-47--0700.xcresult`.
- No screenshots captured for this pass.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - M3 Supabase Foundation

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `d0f624c`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: start M3 backend foundation with Supabase schema/RLS/RPC contract artifacts before wiring iOS Clerk UI. Include question-definition support so future user-created/custom questions can be added without changing answer columns.

Environment note:

- `supabase` CLI is not installed locally.
- `psql` is not installed locally.
- I can write migration and SQL policy test files, but cannot execute them in this environment until a Supabase/Postgres runner is available.

Expected files to touch:

- `supabase/migrations/20260602131500_m3_foundation.sql`
- `supabase/tests/rls_visibility.sql`
- `docs/backend/m3-supabase-foundation.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `docs/decisions.md` if M3 backend decisions need to be locked.

Checkpoint:

- Added first M3 migration under `supabase/migrations/`.
- Added pgTAP-style RLS visibility tests under `supabase/tests/`.
- Verified current official Clerk/Supabase docs: native Clerk Supabase integration uses Clerk session tokens, `role=authenticated`, and RLS can read the Clerk user id from `auth.jwt()->>'sub'`.
- Added explicit `question_definitions` support for future user-created questions/inputs:
  - System starter prompts are global.
  - User custom prompts are owner-authored.
  - Attached custom prompt metadata becomes readable only through visible place attributes.
  - Answers stay JSON-backed in `place_attributes`; do not add hardcoded answer columns for new prompts.
- Tightened profile/map RPCs so they return joined place rows with attributes, not raw `user_places` rows.
- Removed authenticated client update access for canonical `places`; future reconciliation should use service-role backend code.
- Added `docs/backend/m3-supabase-foundation.md`.
- Updated `docs/decisions.md` and `docs/open-questions.md` for Clerk `sub` mapping and M3 test-runner status.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - M3 Project Setup And Verification

Agent: Codex plus sub-agents `Godel` and `Epicurus`
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `08b7aca`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: proceed with M3 setup using new Supabase and Clerk projects, verify the Supabase migration/RLS tests, and document any account/credential blockers.

Coordination:

- Spawned Supabase setup explorer sub-agent `Godel`.
- Spawned Clerk setup explorer sub-agent `Epicurus`.
- Mission Control create-task attempt to `http://localhost:4000/api/tasks` failed because localhost:4000 was not reachable.

Expected files to touch:

- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `docs/backend/m3-supabase-foundation.md`
- `docs/setup.md` if local Supabase/Clerk setup commands are confirmed
- Supabase config files if CLI initialization succeeds

Initial local findings:

- `brew`, `npm`, and `npx` are available.
- `supabase`, `psql`, and `clerk` CLIs are not currently installed.
- Existing `supabase/` folder contains the M3 migration/test artifacts only.

Checkpoint:

- Supabase sub-agent `Godel` confirmed no existing Wander Supabase project was linked, no local Docker, no `psql`, no Supabase access token before login, and noted generated config expected missing `supabase/seed.sql`.
- Clerk sub-agent `Epicurus` confirmed no existing Wander Clerk app/config and found iOS bundle id `com.grayline.wander` in `project.yml`.
- Logged into Supabase CLI with Joe's browser verification.
- Created new Supabase hosted project:
  - Name: `wander`
  - Ref: `rugmtlgufrhlxwfkumhw`
  - Region: `us-west-2`
- Stored Supabase project ref, DB password, URL, anon key, and service role key in `/Users/joelipshutz/.openclaw/workspace/.env.keys`.
- Ran `npx supabase init` and normalized `supabase/config.toml` project id to `wander`.
- Disabled Supabase seed because generated config referenced missing `supabase/seed.sql`.
- Linked the repo to the new Supabase project.
- Ran migration dry-run: one migration detected, `20260602131500_m3_foundation.sql`.
- Pushed migration to hosted Supabase. PostGIS metadata privilege warnings appeared but migration completed successfully.
- Verified remote migration list: local and remote both have `20260602131500`.
- `npx supabase test db --linked supabase/tests/rls_visibility.sql` failed because the CLI still tried to use Docker.
- Installed temporary Node `pg` client under `/private/tmp/wander-pg-runner` and ran `supabase/tests/rls_visibility.sql` against hosted Postgres.
- Hosted RLS test result: 15 pgTAP assertions, 0 failures.
- Logged into Clerk CLI as `joe@bondaiapp.com`.
- Existing Clerk apps were TheEssayPress and Signal; no Wander app existed.
- Created new Clerk app:
  - Name: `Wander`
  - App id: `app_3Eb3JbpbMDjOA2qKUCqfsZwfct9`
  - Development instance: `ins_3Eb3Je6FO3qfUDIt5n3aTHMxYN1`
  - Development domain: `growing-pheasant-22.clerk.accounts.dev`
- Linked repo to new Clerk app.
- Patched Clerk development session token claims to include `role: authenticated`.
- Pulled Clerk env values into `/private/tmp/wander-clerk.env` and appended them to `.env.keys`.
- Added local Supabase Clerk third-party auth config in `supabase/config.toml`.
- Ran `npx supabase config push`; it pushed generated local auth defaults plus the Clerk config to the new hosted project. Review hosted auth settings before alpha.
- Spawned Edge Function review sub-agent `Fermat`, which flagged handle collision, replay/stale event, delete-event typing, and runtime secret issues before finalizing the webhook.
- Added Clerk profile mirroring migration `20260602140304_clerk_profile_mirroring.sql`:
  - Adds `clerk_updated_at` and `last_clerk_event_id` to `profiles`.
  - Adds `clerk_webhook_events` and `clerk_profile_mirror_state`.
  - Adds `app.mirror_clerk_profile` for duplicate, stale-event, handle-collision, delete-before-create, and soft-delete handling.
- Added public service-role wrapper migration `20260602143000_public_clerk_profile_mirror_rpc.sql` after direct PostgREST testing showed `/rest/v1/rpc/...` only searched the `public` schema.
- Added `supabase/tests/clerk_profile_mirroring.sql`; hosted pgTAP result is 14 assertions, 0 failures.
- Deployed Supabase Edge Function `clerk-profile-webhook`.
- Created Clerk/Svix endpoint `ep_3Eb5WlmjQlDav83RHa3hWxp07wd` pointing to `https://rugmtlgufrhlxwfkumhw.supabase.co/functions/v1/clerk-profile-webhook`.
- Stored the Svix signing secret local-only and set Supabase Edge Function secrets:
  - `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`
  - `WANDER_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `WANDER_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Direct signed Edge Function test passed: Svix-style signature verification, RPC call, and `profiles` lookup all succeeded.
- Real Clerk/Svix create webhook test passed with disposable Clerk dev user `user_3Eb6hVABCXRiZ3tcbdvlu2NAh2j`.
- Real Clerk/Svix delete webhook test passed; the mirrored profile received `deleted_at`.
- Hosted SQL tests rerun through temporary Node `pg` runner:
  - `supabase/tests/rls_visibility.sql`: 15 assertions, 0 failures.
  - `supabase/tests/clerk_profile_mirroring.sql`: 14 assertions, 0 failures.
  - Total: 29 assertions, 0 failures.
- Redeployed the final formatted Edge Function and reran a signed smoke test against the deployed URL; `codex_redeploy_test` profile was created successfully.
- Updated `docs/setup.md`, `docs/backend/m3-supabase-foundation.md`, `docs/open-questions.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, and this log.

Known remaining M3 setup work:

- Add iOS Clerk/Supabase SDK dependencies and repository-boundary wiring.
- Add remote repository tests and auth-gated UI tests.
- Install Docker/OrbStack/Colima if we want the standard local Supabase stack and CLI pgTAP runner.
- Review hosted Supabase Auth settings before alpha because `npx supabase config push` pushed generated local auth defaults plus Clerk config.

## 2026-06-02 14:27 PDT - Codex - M3 iOS Clerk/Supabase Wiring

Agent: Codex plus parallel explorers `Socrates`, `Euclid`, and `Ohm`
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `b8de80d`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated local signing/file-type diff and should remain unstaged unless Joe explicitly asks.

Goal: execute the next slice of the existing engineering plan, not create a new plan: add iOS Clerk/Supabase SDK wiring behind repository/auth boundaries, introduce auth gates at save/sync/follow/social-save intent points, and keep views from calling Clerk/Supabase directly.

Coordination:

- Source plan: `docs/plans/2026-06-01-wander-ios-eng-plan.md`, especially M3 Clerk + Supabase Foundation and D14 auth gates.
- Mission Control task creation to `http://localhost:4000/api/tasks` failed because localhost:4000 is not reachable.
- GBrain search for Wander Clerk/Supabase context timed out on a PGLite lock; proceeding from repo docs and this agent log.
- Spawned parallel explorers:
  - `Socrates`: project.yml/SwiftPM dependency mechanics.
  - `Euclid`: service/repository boundary recommendations.
  - `Ohm`: UI auth-gate insertion points.

Expected files to touch:

- `project.yml`
- `Wander/App/*`
- `Wander/Services/Auth/*`
- `Wander/Services/Remote/*`
- `Wander/Services/RepositoryProtocols.swift`
- Feature files only where auth gates are wired.
- `WanderTests/*` for auth/repository contract coverage.
- `docs/agent-log.md`, and docs/decisions/open-questions only if new durable decisions appear.

Initial implementation checklist:

- Add Clerk/Supabase SwiftPM packages through XcodeGen.
- Add auth session provider and minimal auth gate state.
- Add Supabase client factory using local non-secret config and Clerk session token boundary.
- Add remote repository shells/DTOs behind protocols.
- Gate save/sync/follow/social-save intents without implementing full onboarding.
- Regenerate Xcode project and run the full `xcodebuild test` command before committing.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex - Discover People Rail Fix

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `89988a0`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has an unstaged local signing/team diff containing `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Y7TVK75RZ8`, generated app file type churn, and target-attribute cleanup. Treat as unrelated unless Joe explicitly wants signing metadata committed.

Goal: update Discover's people rail so it starts with an add-person affordance and only shows users who are actually on Wander. Non-Wander contact rows should not appear in the people rail.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `WanderTests/WanderStoreTests.swift` or related tests if store behavior needs coverage
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion checkpoint:

- Changed `WanderStore.contactMatches()` to exclude contacts without a matched Wander `userID`, so non-Wander contacts are not shown in social rails.
- Updated Discover people rail to show a fixed add-person card to the left of the horizontal people scroll. Tapping it seeds username search with `@` and focuses the search field.
- Deduplicated Discover profile search results against matched contact user IDs, so Maya does not appear twice when also returned from username search.
- Visual QA screenshots:
  - `DerivedData/visual-sweep/after-discover-add-rail-iphone16plus.png`
  - `DerivedData/visual-sweep/after-discover-add-rail-iphone16e.png`
- Tests: `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: 21 tests, 0 failures.
- Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.01_17-06-34--0700.xcresult`.
- Remaining local caveat: `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has the unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted unless Joe asks.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - Map Filter Label Alternatives

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `7d58068`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: quickly mock alternate active/inactive treatments for the Map filter/label chips because the current selected state is not clear enough. Produce a reviewable HTML/PNG artifact, not production SwiftUI changes yet.

Expected files to touch:

- `preview/map-filter-label-alts/index.html`
- `preview/map-filter-label-alts/map-filter-label-alts.png` if rendering succeeds
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- Joe clarified this should be a focused color/border state study, not full phone mocks.
- Added focused artifact: `preview/map-filter-label-alts/states.html`.
- Rendered PNG: `preview/map-filter-label-alts/map-filter-state-options.png`.
- Recommendation in the mock: Option 2, active = white fill + terracotta ring/check, inactive = faded bone fill + muted border/hollow icon.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - M2 Visual Acceptance Pass

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `7d58068`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff. Existing uncommitted work includes the map filter state mock artifacts and this log.

Goal: implement Joe's approved M2 visual feedback before M3: map filter active ring states, place labels on map, selected/tapped pin state, selected place expanded screen for Larchmont Noodles, facepile/social proof instead of "`Name`'s tip", simpler screen titles, Profile organization cleanup, and Discover hierarchy with places above filters plus my/friends place toggle.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Services/DiscoverModels.swift`
- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift` only if QA launch support needs a selected map state
- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion checkpoint:

- Locked M2 visual decisions in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Map:
  - Active filters now keep the bone/sand chip fill and add a terracotta ring/icon.
  - Removed the `friends` map filter chip per Joe; map scope now shows `you`, `social`, `been`, `wanna`.
  - Added vertical padding to the chip rail so active outlines do not clip.
  - Added map place labels and selected/tapped pin styling.
  - Added expandable selected place sheet and QA launch args for Larchmont Noodles.
  - Replaced "`Name`'s tip" with facepile/social proof copy like "Ryan saved it".
- Discover:
  - Simplified title to `discover`.
  - People section stays near the top under search.
  - Places are the primary content above filters.
  - Added `my places` / `friends' places` toggle and matching store scope.
- Profile:
  - Simplified title to `profile`.
  - Removed bio quote from the owner header.
  - Moved following/followers/friends into a lower `people` section.
- Settings:
  - Simplified title to `settings`.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - M3 iOS Wiring Checkpoint

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `b8de80d`
Starting status: local `main` matched `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` already had unrelated local generated/signing churn and should not be committed unless intentional.

Goal: continue the existing engineering plan's M3 iOS work, not create a new plan. Wire Clerk/Supabase behind service boundaries, gate account-required UI actions, add contract tests, then regenerate/build/test.

Checkpoint:

- Confirmed Mission Control was not reachable locally and GBrain was locked earlier; continued from repo docs and existing eng plan.
- Closed completed subagents after folding in their findings.
- Added Clerk/Supabase package/config entries in `project.yml`, app Info.plist keys, and associated-domain entitlements.
- Added `AuthSessionProviding`, `ClerkAuthService`, `AuthGateSheet`, `WanderSupabaseClient`, Supabase DTOs, and Supabase repository conformers.
- Wired auth gate state at `WanderApp` / `WanderRootView`.
- Gated Add sync intent, Discover follow/social save, Map social save, Profile follow/unfollow/block, graph-list follow/unfollow, Settings unblock/data-sync.
- Replaced the placeholder Supabase RPC shell with a REST RPC transport that attaches the Clerk/Supabase JWT through `Authorization`.
- Added tests:
  - `WanderTests/AuthSessionTests.swift`
  - `WanderTests/RemoteRepositoryTests.swift`
  - `WanderTests/BoundaryImportTests.swift`

Next: run `xcodegen generate`, inspect generated project churn carefully, then build/test and fix compile/API issues.

Completion checkpoint:

- Ran `xcodegen generate` successfully and confirmed the project churn is the intentional SwiftPM/package/entitlements wiring for Clerk and Supabase.
- SwiftPM resolved:
  - Clerk iOS at `1.1.4`
  - Supabase Swift at `2.46.0`
- Fixed the first full test failure by removing `convertFromSnakeCase` from the remote DTO decoder, since the DTOs already use explicit snake_case `CodingKeys`.
- Full test command:
  `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: 32 tests, 0 failures.
- Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.02_14-47-32--0700.xcresult`.
- Files changed for the commit include `project.yml`, generated `Wander.xcodeproj` package references/SwiftPM lockfile, backend config/auth/remote service files, auth gates across M2 UI surfaces, and the three new test files.
- Known caveat: project signing/team settings are local-machine state and should remain uncommitted if Xcode reintroduces them.

## 2026-06-02 18:54 PDT - Codex - M3 Remote Wiring Continuation

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `1051878`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has only the expected uncommitted local `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Y7TVK75RZ8` signing diff and should remain uncommitted.

Goal: continue the existing M3 plan by moving from service-boundary scaffolding toward live app behavior. Add a backend container/fallback path so signed-in social actions can attempt Supabase RPCs without views importing Clerk/Supabase, keep local-first behavior when signed out/offline, and document local secret setup for the smoke test.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/App/WanderApp.swift`
- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift`
- `Wander/App/WanderBackend.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Remote/SupabaseRepositories.swift`
- `WanderTests/RemoteRepositoryTests.swift`
- `WanderTests/AuthSessionTests.swift` if auth store behavior needs a regression test
- `docs/setup.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Initial findings:

- Mission Control is still unavailable on `localhost:4000`.
- GBrain timed out waiting for the PGLite lock, so this pass is using checked-in Wander docs as source of truth.
- The M3 exit criteria still missing in-app are: sign-in smoke test with local publishable keys, profile mirror confirmation from the app, local saved-place sync, and visible social pin fetch.

Completion checkpoint:

- Added `WanderBackend` as the app-level remote repository container.
- `AuthSessionStore` now conforms to `AuthSessionProviding`, so Supabase RPC transport can get Clerk-issued Supabase tokens without views importing Clerk/Supabase.
- Wired Map/Discover/Profile/Settings social actions through remote-aware `WanderStore` methods:
  - remote profile search can merge into Discover username results
  - remote visible places can refresh into a cache for the Map surface
  - follow/unfollow/block/unblock attempt remote calls when signed in/configured
  - social save attempts `save_visible_place` and marks local copy `synced` on success or `failed` on remote failure
- Preserved local-first behavior for signed-out/offline flows and left full retry/claim queue for M4.
- Updated `docs/setup.md` with the local-only build setting injection pattern for live Clerk/Supabase smoke tests.
- Ran `xcodegen generate`.
- Full test command:
  `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: 35 tests, 0 failures.
- Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.02_19-03-34--0700.xcresult`.
- Remaining known gap: live sign-in/profile-mirror smoke test still needs to be run with local publishable keys injected into the simulator build.

## 2026-06-02 20:54 PDT - Codex - M3 Extra-High Audit

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `89bca2f`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has only the expected uncommitted local `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Y7TVK75RZ8` signing diff and should remain uncommitted.

Goal: audit the M3 auth/remote wiring before live Clerk/Supabase smoke testing or deeper M4 sync work. Focus on code/SQL contract shape, Clerk token assumptions, local-first sync transitions, UI state/error gaps, and test coverage.

Parallel audit helpers:

- Backend contract audit: compare Swift RPC names/params/DTOs to Supabase migrations/functions.
- iOS app wiring audit: inspect environment object injection, auth/session behavior, async social actions, local-first state, and test gaps.

Expected files to touch:

- `docs/agent-log.md`
- Potentially `docs/open-questions.md` or implementation files only if the audit finds a clear mismatch that is safer to fix immediately.

Initial findings:

- Mission Control remains unavailable on `localhost:4000`.
- GBrain lookup is slow/locked again; this audit is using repo docs and code as source of truth.

Completion checkpoint:

- Parallel backend audit found:
  - app RPCs lived only under private `app.*`, while PostgREST exposes `public` by default.
  - `save_visible_place` returned `public.user_places` but Swift expected `{ "user_place_id": ... }`.
  - `unblock_user` had an app surface but no SQL/RPC implementation.
  - `block_user` likely could not delete reciprocal follow rows under the existing delete RLS policy.
  - Clerk default token path still needs live verification.
- Parallel iOS audit found:
  - social-save could call remote with local fixture IDs instead of backend UUIDs.
  - remote profile search shells were not cached, so tapping a remote-only search result could open a blank profile sheet.
  - failed unfollow/unblock removed local state even if remote mutation failed.
  - remote attributes, remote relationship filtering, and visible error/retry UI need later cleanup.
- Fixes made:
  - Added migration `20260602210000_public_app_rpc_wrappers.sql`.
  - Added public PostgREST wrappers for app-facing RPCs and a JSON response shape for `public.save_visible_place`.
  - Added `app.unblock_user` / `public.unblock_user`.
  - Redefined `app.block_user` as a guarded `security definer` so hard block cleanup can remove both follow directions.
  - Wired `SupabaseBlockRepository.unblock`.
  - Changed remote social-save to require real UUID `serverID`s and pass server IDs, not fixture IDs.
  - Cached remote profile shells from Discover search.
  - Changed remote unfollow/unblock failures to keep local rows marked `failed` instead of deleting them.
- Applied the new migration to hosted Supabase with `npx supabase db push --linked`; migration `20260602210000_public_app_rpc_wrappers.sql` completed successfully.
- Full test command:
  `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: 39 tests, 0 failures.
- Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.02_20-59-22--0700.xcresult`.
- Remaining known gaps before expanding M4:
  - live Clerk token/Supabase RLS smoke test
  - remote attributes hydration
  - remote relationship/filter hydration
  - explicit user-visible sync error/retry UI for failed follow/block/social-save

## 2026-06-02 21:08 PDT - Codex - M3 Live Smoke

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `4b57c3e`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has only the expected uncommitted local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted.

Goal: run the M3 live Clerk + Supabase smoke path before adding more M4 sync work. Verify whether the current iOS token path can satisfy Supabase RLS/RPCs, then test the app/backend paths for profile/search/follow/block/social-save as far as local credentials and simulator access allow.

Expected files to touch:

- `docs/agent-log.md`
- Potentially `Wander/Services/Auth/ClerkAuthService.swift`, setup docs, or tests if the smoke exposes a fixable token/RPC/config mismatch.

Initial findings:

- Mission Control is unavailable on `localhost:4000`.
- GBrain lookup is still slow/locked; proceeding from repo docs and checked-in setup state.
- The app currently requests `Clerk.shared.auth.getToken()` without an explicit template, so the first smoke target is token acceptance by Supabase RLS/RPCs.

Checkpoint:

- Created temporary smoke runner at `/private/tmp/wander-m3-live-smoke.mjs` to avoid committing secrets or test-only code.
- The first run failed in the sandbox with `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.clerk.com`; reran with approved network access.
- Hosted smoke results:
  - Clerk disposable user creation passed.
  - Clerk -> Svix -> Supabase Edge Function profile mirroring passed.
  - Clerk default session token minted successfully and decoded locally with:
    - `sub=<viewer Clerk user id>`
    - `role=authenticated`
    - `iss=https://growing-pheasant-22.clerk.accounts.dev`
    - `alg=RS256`
    - `kid=ins_3Eb3Je6FO3qfUDIt5n3aTHMxYN1`
  - Clerk JWKS at `https://growing-pheasant-22.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json` returned HTTP 200 and contains that `kid`.
  - Supabase service-role seed setup passed.
  - First authenticated public RPC call with the Clerk token failed before RLS with `401 PGRST301 No suitable key was found to decode the JWT`.
  - Reran `supabase config push`; CLI reported remote API/DB/Auth/Storage config all up to date.
  - Reran the smoke after config push; same `PGRST301` Clerk token decode failure.
  - Control request using Supabase anon JWT against the same public RPC reached `42501 permission denied for function search_profiles_by_handle`, confirming PostgREST/RPC exposure is live and Supabase can decode its own JWT.
- Conclusion: do not proceed to M4 sync or simulator remote-action debugging yet. The current blocker is hosted Supabase Clerk third-party auth verification/key registration, not Swift app code or public RPC wrapper exposure.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex - M3 Auth Provider Follow-Up

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `ce1c316`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has only the expected local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted.

Goal: answer whether the Clerk/Supabase verifier blocker can be fixed through CLI, and clarify whether Supabase OAuth Server must be enabled.

Checkpoint:

- Verified current docs: the relevant hosted Supabase path is **Authentication -> Sign In / Providers -> Add provider -> Clerk**, not the OAuth Server page.
- OAuth Server being enabled is unrelated to accepting Clerk third-party JWTs.
- Re-ran `supabase config push --project-ref rugmtlgufrhlxwfkumhw`; CLI reported remote Auth config up to date.
- Re-ran the hosted Clerk-token smoke after explicit config push; Supabase still returned `401 PGRST301 No suitable key was found to decode the JWT`.
- Ran `npx supabase@latest config push --project-ref rugmtlgufrhlxwfkumhw` using Supabase CLI `2.105.0`; it also reported remote Auth config up to date.
- Re-ran the hosted Clerk-token smoke again after latest CLI push; same `PGRST301` failure.
- Checked Clerk OIDC discovery and JWKS:
  - OIDC issuer: `https://growing-pheasant-22.clerk.accounts.dev`
  - JWKS URI: `https://growing-pheasant-22.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json`
  - JWKS contains `kid=ins_3Eb3Je6FO3qfUDIt5n3aTHMxYN1`
- Conclusion: CLI config push is not resolving hosted PostgREST's Clerk verifier. Next action is to add/verify the Clerk provider row in Supabase Dashboard under Authentication -> Sign In / Providers, or use the authenticated browser to do that UI step.

## 2026-06-04 08:27 PDT - Codex - M3 Auth Provider Retest

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `8517e08`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has only the expected local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted.

Goal: rerun the hosted Clerk-to-Supabase smoke after Joe added the Clerk provider connection in the Supabase dashboard using the `https://growing-pheasant-22.clerk.accounts.dev` domain.

Expected files to touch:

- `docs/agent-log.md`
- Potentially setup/open-question docs if the smoke result changes M3 status.

Completion checkpoint:

- Created temporary smoke runner at `/private/tmp/wander-m3-live-smoke.mjs`; no secrets or runner code committed.
- Hosted smoke passed after the Supabase Clerk connection was added:
  - Clerk disposable user creation passed.
  - Clerk profile mirroring passed.
  - Default Clerk session token had `alg=RS256`, `kid=ins_3Eb3Je6FO3qfUDIt5n3aTHMxYN1`, `iss=https://growing-pheasant-22.clerk.accounts.dev`, `role=authenticated`, and `sub` matched the viewer Clerk user id.
  - Supabase accepted the Clerk token.
  - Authenticated RPCs passed: `search_profiles_by_handle`, `follow_user`, `visible_places_in_view`, `save_visible_place`, `block_user`, `unblock_user`, and `unfollow_user`.
- Updated `docs/open-questions.md`, `docs/backend/m3-supabase-foundation.md`, and `docs/setup.md` from blocked to passed.
- Ran simulator build with local public Clerk/Supabase keys injected:
  `xcodebuild build -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6" -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO ...`
- Result: build succeeded.
- Next: app-level simulator smoke for actual Clerk sign-in UI and remote-backed social actions.

## 2026-06-04 10:18 PDT - Codex - Settings Sign Out

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `7c30e20`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has only the expected local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted.

Goal: add a real sign-out path so simulator/device testing can leave Joe's restored Clerk session and exercise signed-out/sign-in flows.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Services/Auth/AuthSessionProviding.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Auth/ClerkAuthService.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Settings/SettingsScreen.swift`
- `WanderTests/AuthSessionTests.swift`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Initial findings:

- Current app has sign-in gates but no sign-out or account-switch surface.
- Clerk iOS SDK exposes `try await Clerk.shared.auth.signOut()`.

Completion checkpoint:

- Added `signOut()` to the auth session boundary and implemented it through `Clerk.shared.auth.signOut()`.
- Added Settings account state UI: signed-in identity summary, sign-out action with loading/error state, signed-out sign-in action, and loading/unavailable fallbacks.
- Added auth session tests for successful sign-out clearing the session and failed sign-out preserving the active session while surfacing an error.
- First test compile failed because Settings referenced a non-existent `WanderTheme.sky` token; fixed to use the existing social-pin token.
- Ran full test suite:
  `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed, 41 tests, 0 failures. Result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.04_10-21-43--0700.xcresult`.
- Known remaining local diff: `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` signing/team settings, intentionally uncommitted.

## 2026-06-04 10:24 PDT - Codex - TestFlight Readiness Check

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `1517a4b`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has only the expected local `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Y7TVK75RZ8` diff.

Goal: answer whether the current Wander repo can be pushed to TestFlight from this machine.

Findings:

- The app target bundle id is `com.grayline.wander`.
- `project.yml` intentionally has no committed `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`; local generated project state has team `Y7TVK75RZ8`, still uncommitted.
- Local code-signing identity check returned `0 valid identities found`, so this machine cannot currently produce a signed App Store/TestFlight archive from CLI.
- Existing local App Store Connect env key `ASC_BUNDLE_ID` is not `com.grayline.wander`, so the current ASC env appears to be for another app/workflow and should not be reused blindly for Wander uploads.
- No repo TestFlight lane exists yet: no `ExportOptions.plist`, `Fastfile`, `.ipa`, or `.xcarchive` was found.
- Release hygiene issue: `project.yml` says `MARKETING_VERSION = 0.1`, but `Wander/Resources/Info.plist` hardcodes `CFBundleShortVersionString` to `1.0`; fix before first TestFlight upload so versioning is predictable.
- Sandbox-only `xcodebuild -list`/`-showBuildSettings` checks failed on cache/CoreSimulator permissions; this does not change the signing conclusion.

Conclusion:

- Not ready to upload to TestFlight from CLI yet.
- Next setup steps: add/use a Wander-specific App Store Connect app/bundle config, install or create an Apple Distribution signing identity/provisioning path for `com.grayline.wander`, add a release export/upload lane, fix Info.plist version build settings, then archive/upload.

## 2026-06-04 10:32 PDT - Codex - Simulator Auth Config And Sign-Out Visibility

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `e01ca73`
Starting status: local `main` is ahead of `origin/main` by the TestFlight readiness log commit; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has the local signing/team diff.

Goal: fix Joe's simulator screenshot showing `Missing Clerk publishable key.` in Settings, then continue TestFlight setup.

Findings:

- The Settings sign-out implementation exists, but the simulator app was built without `WANDER_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- With missing Clerk config, `ClerkAuthService` sets auth state to `.unavailable("Missing Clerk publishable key.")`, so the account card cannot show the signed-in state or sign-out control.
- Immediate fix path: rebuild/install the simulator app with the local-only public Clerk/Supabase client keys injected via an xcconfig so the values are not printed in command output.
- UI improvement path: make Settings show a full-width account action button instead of relying on the small trailing `sign out` button.

Completion checkpoint:

- Updated Settings account UI so signed-in state shows a full-width `sign out` button and signed-out state shows a matching full-width `sign in` button.
- Added unavailable-state helper copy so missing auth config points to the local auth-config rebuild issue.
- Created temporary local auth xcconfig at `/private/tmp/wander-live-auth.xcconfig` from local env values; do not commit this file.
- First sandboxed configured test run failed due Xcode cache/CoreSimulator permissions and printed build settings; reran quietly with elevated Xcode access for subsequent runs.
- Fixed one compile issue from the UI tweak (`WanderTheme.cream` -> `WanderTheme.textOnAction`).
- Ran configured full test suite:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData -xcconfig /private/tmp/wander-live-auth.xcconfig CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- Built configured simulator app and installed/launched it on iPhone 17 Pro simulator `066417CD-C3D5-4209-BA1F-46152B1A6AAC` into Settings.
- Verification screenshot: `/private/tmp/wander-settings-auth.png`; Settings now shows `Signed out` and a large `sign in` button instead of `Missing Clerk publishable key.`
- Expected behavior: after sign-in, the same account card shows the large `sign out` button.

## 2026-06-04 10:41 PDT - Codex - TestFlight Archive Attempt

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `1a9887b`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has the local signing/team diff.

Goal: attempt to prepare and upload a Wander TestFlight build after fixing the simulator auth configuration issue.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Resources/Info.plist`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Initial findings:

- Release metadata hygiene issue: `Info.plist` hardcoded `CFBundleShortVersionString` to `1.0` while `project.yml` uses `MARKETING_VERSION = 0.1`.
- Fixed `Info.plist` to read `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` and `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` so archives use project build settings.
- Next step is a signed `xcodebuild archive` with local public auth config injected through `/private/tmp/wander-live-auth.xcconfig`, automatic signing, and team `Y7TVK75RZ8`.

Checkpoint:

- Signed archive succeeded at `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1.xcarchive`.
- Export/upload attempt failed before package upload with `IDEDistribution.DistributionAppRecordProviderError.missingApp(bundleId: "com.grayline.wander")`.
- Distribution logs showed App Store Connect auth worked and queried provider `7f20b667-afd3-456b-b2bc-ca94ab295484`, but returned zero apps for `com.grayline.wander`.
- Conclusion: signing is now good enough to archive; the current blocker is that no App Store Connect app record exists for `com.grayline.wander`.
- Added release prep for the next attempt:
  - `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = 1`
  - `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon`
  - `UIRequiresFullScreen = true`
  - generated a temporary/simple AppIcon asset catalog for validation unblock; replace with final brand icon later.

Completion checkpoint:

- Added tracked `Wander/Config/Auth.xcconfig`, ignored `Wander/Config/LocalAuth.xcconfig`, and project wiring so normal Xcode builds can use local public Clerk/Supabase client keys without committing key values.
- Created local ignored `Wander/Config/LocalAuth.xcconfig` from `/Users/joelipshutz/.openclaw/workspace/.env.keys`.
- Regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` from `project.yml`; `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Y7TVK75RZ8` is now intentional project configuration.
- Verified no local public client key values are present in tracked files.
- Ran regenerated-project tests:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- Fresh signed archive succeeded at `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1.xcarchive` after the icon/full-screen/project config changes.
- Updated `docs/setup.md` with local auth config setup and the App Store Connect app-record blocker.
- Exact remaining TestFlight step: create an App Store Connect iOS app record for `com.grayline.wander` (suggested name `Wander`, SKU `wander-ios`). Then rerun upload.
- Follow-up correction: XcodeGen rewrites `Wander/Resources/Info.plist`, so version/full-screen keys now live in `project.yml` `info.properties`.
- Reran `xcodegen generate`.
- Reran tests after the final generated project/plist changes: passed.
- Rebuilt the final signed archive at `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1.xcarchive`: passed.

## 2026-06-04 11:03 PDT - Codex - TestFlight Upload Retry

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `5cee10c`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: rerun App Store Connect upload after Joe created the `com.grayline.wander` app record.

Expected files to touch:

- `docs/agent-log.md`

Plan:

- Reuse `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1.xcarchive` from the successful signed archive.
- Recreate upload export options if needed.
- Run `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with `destination=upload`.
- Log the upload result or the next exact Apple validation blocker.

Completion checkpoint:

- Recreated `/private/tmp/WanderExportUpload.plist`.
- Ran:
  `xcodebuild -quiet -exportArchive -archivePath /private/tmp/Wander-0.1.xcarchive -exportPath /private/tmp/WanderTestFlightUpload -exportOptionsPlist /private/tmp/WanderExportUpload.plist -allowProvisioningUpdates`
- App Store Connect found the newly-created `com.grayline.wander` app record.
- Apple package analysis passed.
- Upload reached 100% and completed successfully.
- Final Xcode output: `Uploaded Wander`.
- Current state: build uploaded to App Store Connect and is processing before it can be used in TestFlight.

## 2026-06-04 17:49 PDT - Codex - M4 Fixture Opt-In Start

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `ac9850d`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: start M4 by removing seeded demo people/places from default app launches. Joe confirmed TestFlight sign-in works, but external testers should not see Joe/Maya/Ryan/Woodcat fixture data unless a demo/test mode is explicitly requested.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Services/WanderFixtures.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Auth/AuthSessionProviding.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Auth/ClerkAuthService.swift`
- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift`
- `WanderTests/NavigationContractTests.swift`
- `WanderTests/WanderStoreTests.swift`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Plan:

- Add an empty/default fixture set with a generic local profile.
- Keep the existing seeded fixture set for tests and screenshots.
- Make `WanderRootView` choose fixtures from a launch argument; default to empty.
- Add a launch flag for seeded demo fixtures.
- Sync the local current profile shell from the authenticated Clerk session when present.

Completion checkpoint:

- Added `WanderFixtures.empty()` and changed `WanderRootView` to use empty fixtures by default.
- Preserved seeded Joe/Maya/Ryan fixture data behind the explicit `-WanderUseDemoFixtures` launch argument for screenshots/local demos/tests, and prevented auth refresh from overwriting seeded demo mode.
- Added session email to `AuthSession` and mapped Clerk `primaryEmailAddress` into the local profile shell.
- Added `WanderStore.apply(authState:)` so signed-in users see a local profile derived from the Clerk session instead of fixture Joe, and signed-out/default launches stay generic.
- Added tests for default-empty fixture mode, explicit demo-fixture mode, empty local stores, and signed-in profile-shell hydration.
- First sandboxed test run failed on CoreSimulator/SwiftPM cache permissions only.
- Elevated test run found one test compile issue (`VisiblePlace` is not `Equatable`); changed that assertion to `isEmpty`.
- Reran full test suite:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from `1` to `2` in `project.yml` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` with `xcodegen generate`.
- Reran the full test suite after regeneration; result: passed.
- Built signed archive:
  `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build2.xcarchive`
- Result: archive succeeded.
- First `xcodebuild -exportArchive` upload attempt failed before packaging with `Failed to Use Accounts`; distribution logs said Xcode could not find App Store Connect access for team `Y7TVK75RZ8`.
- Retried export/upload with the local App Store Connect API key via `-authenticationKeyPath`, `-authenticationKeyID`, and `-authenticationKeyIssuerID`.
- Result: App Store Connect analysis passed, upload reached 100%, and Xcode output ended with `Uploaded Wander`.
- Made one follow-up root-flow correction so demo fixture mode stays stable after signed-out auth refresh.
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from `2` to `3`, regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj`, and reran the full test suite; result: passed.
- Built signed archive:
  `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build3.xcarchive`
- Uploaded build `0.1 (3)` through `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with the App Store Connect API key.
- Result: App Store Connect analysis passed, upload reached 100%, and Xcode output ended with `Uploaded Wander`.
- Current state: build `0.1 (3)` is uploaded and processing in App Store Connect. This build should remove fake seeded people/places from default/TestFlight launches while keeping sign-in available.

## 2026-06-04 18:19 PDT - Codex - M4 QA Pass Start

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `2261cd4`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: run the M4 QA pass after Joe confirmed the first TestFlight smoke and M4 remote-sync slice are done.

Mission Control: `http://localhost:4000/api/tasks` is unreachable from this session, so this log is the active coordination record.

Expected files to touch:

- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `docs/roadmap.md`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `docs/setup.md`
- possible small QA fixes if checks expose a concrete bug

QA scope:

- Fresh signed-out install behavior.
- New signed-in account behavior.
- Existing signed-in account behavior.
- Sign out and sign back in behavior.
- Build/test status and whether a new TestFlight upload is needed.

Checkpoint:

- Ran full Xcode test suite. First sandboxed run failed on CoreSimulator/SwiftPM cache permissions only. Elevated run passed:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Installed and launched the debug build on the previously-used iPhone 17 Pro simulator. It showed `JL`, but that simulator had a prior Clerk/keychain session, so it represented an existing-session path rather than true first-run.
- Created a temporary clean simulator `Wander-M4-QA` (`4252EC90-35A5-4018-82AA-4BFEBAD0289B`) to verify true first-run behavior.
- Clean first-run initially showed `JL` in the map search avatar even with no session. Root cause: `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift` hardcoded `WanderAvatar(initials: "JL", ...)`.
- Fixed the map search avatar to use `store.currentUser.initials`. On clean first-run it now shows generic `Y` from the default `You` profile and no seeded Joe/Maya/Ryan/Woodcat place content.
- Reran the full Xcode test suite after the avatar fix; result: passed.
- QA blocker found: direct signed-in own-place remote save is still not implemented in `SupabaseUserPlaceRepository.save(_:)` (`notImplemented("direct user place save RPC")`). Current remote wiring covers visible places, profile search, follow/unfollow, block/unblock, and social save, but not direct add/save to Supabase.

Completion checkpoint:

- Updated `docs/roadmap.md` to mark M3 as done baseline and M4 as in QA/blocked on direct signed-in own-place save.
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from `3` to `4` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj`.
- Reran full Xcode test suite after regeneration:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- Built signed archive:
  `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build4.xcarchive`
- Uploaded build `0.1 (4)` through `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with the App Store Connect API key.
- Result: App Store Connect analysis passed, upload reached 100%, and Xcode output ended with `Uploaded Wander`.
- Current state: build `0.1 (4)` is uploaded and processing in App Store Connect. It includes the clean first-run avatar fix, but M4 QA is not green until direct signed-in own-place save is implemented and retested.

## 2026-06-04 18:49 PDT - Codex - M4 Direct Own-Place Save Start

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `436488d`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: close the M4 QA blocker by implementing direct signed-in own-place save to Supabase for current-location/manual add.

Mission Control: `http://localhost:4000/api/tasks` is still unreachable from this session, so this log is the active coordination record.

Expected files to touch:

- `supabase/migrations/*_save_own_place.sql`
- `Wander/Services/RepositoryProtocols.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Remote/SupabaseRepositories.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`

- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `docs/roadmap.md`
- `docs/setup.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Plan:

- Add a Supabase RPC for upserting a canonical place, current user's user_place row, and flexible question attributes.
- Add the public PostgREST wrapper and grants.
- Implement `SupabaseUserPlaceRepository.save(_:)`.
- Wire signed-in Add flow to local-first save, then remote save with synced/failed local state.
- Add contract tests for request shape and local success/failure fallback.
- Run full tests, apply hosted migration if possible, then upload a new TestFlight build.

Checkpoint:

- Added migration `20260604185000_save_own_place.sql` with `app.save_own_place` plus public PostgREST wrapper.
- Wired signed-in current-location/manual Add saves through local-first store save, `WanderBackend.saveUserPlace`, and `SupabaseUserPlaceRepository.save(_:)`.
- Added tests for `save_own_place` RPC body shape and local success/failure sync marking.
- Applied the hosted Supabase migration with `npx supabase db push --linked`; Supabase finished the migration successfully.
- Ran the full Xcode test suite after the direct-save changes:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- Updated M4 docs to show direct-save is no longer the blocker; build `0.1 (5)` is the next TestFlight QA candidate.

Completion checkpoint:

- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from `4` to `5` in `project.yml` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` with `xcodegen generate`.
- Reran the full Xcode test suite after regeneration:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- Built signed archive:
  `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build5.xcarchive`
- Uploaded build `0.1 (5)` through `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with the App Store Connect API key.
- Result: App Store Connect analysis passed, upload reached 90%, and Xcode output ended with `Uploaded Wander`.
- Current state: build `0.1 (5)` is uploaded and processing in App Store Connect. Next step is Joe device-smoke testing direct current-location/manual save on TestFlight after processing completes.

## 2026-06-05 09:47 PDT - Codex - Public TestFlight Link Setup

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `89e22bd`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: create/find the public TestFlight share link for Wander.

Actions:

- Queried App Store Connect for app bundle `com.grayline.wander`; app id is `6776850787`, name is `Wander: Find Places`.
- Initial TestFlight beta group query returned no groups.
- Created external beta group `Wander Alpha` with public link enabled, feedback enabled, and 100-tester cap.
- Public link created: `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`.
- Attempted to attach build `0.1 (5)` (`7fdc7c41-12e6-40ff-88cd-3348e2942c88`) to the group.
- App Store Connect rejected the build attach with `Build is not assignable` / `Build is not in an externally assignable state.`
- Follow-up query showed build `0.1 (5)` is `VALID`, but `usesNonExemptEncryption` is still null and beta app review contact fields are empty.

Current state:

- Public link exists, but it may show no available build until App Store Connect beta review/export compliance is completed and build `0.1 (5)` is attached to `Wander Alpha`.

## 2026-06-05 09:54 PDT - Codex - Attach Build 5 To Public TestFlight

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `638e99a`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: get the latest build onto the public TestFlight link and handle export compliance if possible.

Actions:

- Attempted to patch build `0.1 (5)` export compliance to `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`; Apple returned that the value was already set and cannot be updated.
- Re-queried build `0.1 (5)` and confirmed `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`.
- Retried attaching build `0.1 (5)` (`7fdc7c41-12e6-40ff-88cd-3348e2942c88`) to external group `Wander Alpha`.
- App Store Connect accepted the attach.
- Final read-back showed public link enabled, cap 100, feedback enabled, and build `0.1 (5)` attached.
- Verified `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t` responds with HTTP 200.

Current state:

- Public TestFlight link is live: `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`
- Attached build: `0.1 (5)`
- Export compliance: `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`

## 2026-06-05 15:03 PDT - Codex - TestFlight Link Not Accepting Testers

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `4bf3c3f`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: investigate Joe seeing "not accepting new testers" on the public TestFlight link and open the link to anyone if App Store Connect allows it.

Plan:

- Query current `Wander Alpha` beta group settings, cap, public link state, and attached builds.
- Remove or raise the public-link cap if it is limiting joins.
- If group settings are already open, identify whether Apple beta review or build external availability is the remaining blocker.

Actions:

- Queried `Wander Alpha`; public link was enabled, build `0.1 (5)` was attached, export compliance was `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, and the group still had `publicLinkLimitEnabled=true` with limit 100.
- Queried beta review submission for build `0.1 (5)`; Apple reports `betaReviewState=WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`, submitted `2026-06-05T09:53:38-07:00`.
- Patched `Wander Alpha` to keep public link enabled, keep feedback enabled, and set `publicLinkLimitEnabled=false`.
- App Store Connect accepted the patch. Read-back confirms `publicLinkLimitEnabled=false`, public link still `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`, and build `0.1 (5)` remains attached.

Current state:

- Anyone with the link can join once Apple approves external TestFlight review.
- The remaining blocker is not group settings; it is Apple beta review pending for build `0.1 (5)`.

## 2026-06-05 20:49 PDT - Codex - M5 Add Capture Feedback Logged

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `783c765`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: log Joe's TestFlight feedback and transition from M4 into M5.

Context:

- Joe confirmed sign-in is working and said to move to M5.
- Add flow feedback from TestFlight:
  - No back button once the user starts adding a place.
  - Title should be `add a place`.
  - Remove `where's it from` and `pick a source`; the app should feel like it will fill in what it can.
  - `I'm here now` needs a real location permission ask and nearby-place resolution.
  - Current build still returns deterministic `Maru Coffee`, which is not acceptable for M5.
  - Manual add should resolve real place candidates.
  - Paste link and photo add are still not real extraction.
  - Need clarity that LLM is for parsing/extraction hints, while canonical place identity/coordinates should come from MapKit/place-provider search.

Actions:

- Updated `docs/roadmap.md` to mark M4 as done baseline and M5 as in progress.
- Updated `docs/open-questions.md` with explicit M5 Add capture notes for navigation, copy, location, manual resolution, link extraction, and photo extraction.

## 2026-06-05 20:57 PDT - Codex - M5 Add UX And Place Resolution Start

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `3d0c59a`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Goal: implement the first M5 Add slice: clean Add copy/navigation, remove fake current-location/manual place candidates, and resolve candidates through real iOS location/place search services.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `Wander/Services/RepositoryProtocols.swift`
- new service files under `Wander/Services/`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- focused tests under `WanderTests/`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Plan:

- Add back navigation/escape behavior inside Add after leaving the source state.
- Update Add title/copy to `add a place` and remove the confusing source-picker wording.
- Replace store-level fake candidate methods with async resolution through a place resolver.
- Implement current-location permission + nearby MapKit search for `I'm here now`.
- Implement manual MapKit search using name, area hint, and category hints.
- Keep link/photo as honest unresolved-draft shells until backend extraction jobs are built.

Checkpoint:

- Added `PlaceCandidateResolving` and `MapKitPlaceResolver`.
- `MapKitPlaceResolver` uses CoreLocation one-shot permission/location plus MapKit nearby POI search for `I'm here right now`.
- Manual add now resolves candidates through MapKit local search instead of fabricating a downtown LA candidate.
- `PlaceCandidate` now carries address/locality/region/country/provider metadata; local save preserves those fields.
- Add UI now uses stable title `add a place`, has an in-flow back button, removes `where's it from`/`pick a source` copy, and shows async resolving/error states.
- Added `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` through `project.yml` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj`.
- Added resolver-boundary tests and updated current-location save metadata coverage.
- Full Xcode test suite passed:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from `5` to `6`; build `0.1 (6)` is the next TestFlight candidate for this M5 Add slice.

Completion checkpoint:

- Regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` after the build-number bump.
- Reran the full Xcode test suite after regeneration:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- Built signed archive:
  `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build6.xcarchive`
- Uploaded build `0.1 (6)` through `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with the App Store Connect API key.
- Result: App Store Connect analysis passed, upload succeeded, and Xcode output ended with `Uploaded Wander`.
- App Store Connect build id for `0.1 (6)`: `7c34953e-f7ca-444b-93e2-413572c9b4c1`.
- Set export compliance to `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`.
- Attached build `0.1 (6)` to external group `Wander Alpha`.
- Submitted build `0.1 (6)` for external TestFlight review; Apple reports `betaReviewState=WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`.

Handoff checkpoint, 2026-06-05 21:12 PDT:

- Mission Control task update attempted with `curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/tasks`; local server was not reachable (`curl` exit 7), so this repo log is the active coordination surface for this work.
- Cleanup after review: Add source actions now clear stale resolution messages when switching to link/manual/photo.
- Current remaining M5 scope after this commit: real link extraction, photo extraction/capture, richer detail questions, and backend job plumbing. This slice only replaces fake current-location/manual candidates and cleans the first Add surface/navigation.

Final checkpoint, 2026-06-05 21:16 PDT:

- Implementation commit: `e082b63 feat: resolve add place candidates`; pushed to `origin/main`.
- Verified local `main` and `origin/main` matched `e082b63d022a04b6e3567acb5fd78efda04c8457` after push.
- Rechecked App Store Connect after upload: build `0.1 (6)` external TestFlight review is `APPROVED`.

## 2026-06-05 22:41 PDT - Codex - M5 Link Capture Candidate Flow

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `d563730`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; worktree clean.

Goal: continue M5 by turning paste-link Add from an immediate draft shell into a real candidate-resolution flow for map/location links, while preserving draft fallback for opaque or low-confidence links.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/RepositoryProtocols.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- new service/parser files under `Wander/Services/`
- focused tests under `WanderTests/`
- `project.yml` / `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` if new source files require regeneration
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Plan:

- Add a link-entry step in Add instead of creating a draft immediately.
- Parse obvious place hints from Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Instagram location URLs.
- Resolve parsed hints through MapKit candidate search and require confirmation before save.
- If parsing/resolution fails, keep a draft and offer manual rescue.
- Leave backend extraction jobs and photo import/extraction as the next M5 slices.

Notes:

- Mission Control was checked with `curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/tasks`; it is still unreachable locally (`curl` exit 7), so this repo log remains the coordination record.

Checkpoint:

- Added `LinkPlaceInput` and `PlaceCandidateResolving.resolveLink`.
- Added `LinkPlaceParser` for deterministic local hints from Google Maps place paths, Apple Maps query links, Instagram location slugs, and plain text.
- Added Add `link` step with paste field, `find from link`, and explicit `save as draft` fallback.
- Link candidates now flow through MapKit search and reuse the existing confirm/details/save path with `sourceType = link`.
- Opaque/short links still become drafts instead of fake candidates.
- Added parser tests and store boundary tests.
- Ran full test suite after new files and again after build-number regeneration:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed both runs.
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` to `7`, archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build7.xcarchive`, and uploaded build `0.1 (7)` with `xcodebuild -exportArchive`.
- Upload succeeded and App Store Connect reported `Uploaded Wander`; immediate API polls had not yet surfaced build `7`, so export compliance/public-group attachment remains pending until Apple indexes the build.
- Follow-up App Store Connect poll surfaced build `0.1 (7)` as build id `e7e0991e-bf35-4004-8a80-7bc6eef6e1e2`, processing state `VALID`.
- Set export compliance to `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached build `0.1 (7)` to public group `Wander Alpha`, and submitted it for external TestFlight review.
- Apple reports build `0.1 (7)` beta review state `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`.
- Final App Store Connect check after push: build `0.1 (7)` is `VALID`, `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, and external beta review state is `APPROVED`.

## 2026-06-05 23:06 PDT - Codex - M5 Shared Test Checkpoint

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `0bbc43b`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; worktree clean.

Goal: continue through the remaining M5 work until there is a strong TestFlight checkpoint for Joe and external testers.

Plan:

- Keep backend extraction workers out of this slice because the eng plan marks backend extraction as M6.
- Add a real Add-photo import path using PhotosUI that creates local source-artifact/extraction-job state and a visible draft, instead of a dead source row.
- Add visible parsed Discover filter chips and strengthen the cheap/swappable parser boundary without sending user graph/place/contact data to an external model from the client.
- Add an analytics/event interface and cover it with focused tests/mocks, not a vendor SDK.
- Run full Xcode tests, upload a new TestFlight build, and provide a focused tester script.

Notes:

- Mission Control is still unreachable on `localhost:4000` (`curl` exit 7), so this repo log remains the coordination surface.

Checkpoint:

- Added local source-artifact and extraction-job creation for link/photo unresolved drafts. Backend execution remains M6; this M5 slice creates durable local artifact/job state and keeps draft/manual rescue visible.
- Added PhotosUI photo import in Add. Imported photos create a photo draft plus local image source artifact and pending extraction job; no fake AI candidate is shown.
- Added visible parsed Discover filter chips below the search field.
- Strengthened deterministic parser coverage for category aliases, tags, area, status, relationships, cache, and parser failure fallback behind the existing `LLMFilterParser` protocol.
- Wired parser analytics through the existing `AnalyticsClient` abstraction for `discover_query_parsed`, `discover_parse_failed`, `place_saved`, and `extraction_job_started`.
- Added tests for photo/link draft artifacts, idempotent artifact/job creation, Discover chips, parser cache, parser failure, and analytics events.
- Ran full test suite before and after the build number bump:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed both runs.
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` to `8`, archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build8.xcarchive`, and uploaded build `0.1 (8)` with `xcodebuild -exportArchive`.
- App Store Connect build id for `0.1 (8)`: `0c4f9998-4f74-4491-9811-5a2e885c2677`; processing state `VALID`.
- Set export compliance to `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached build `0.1 (8)` to public group `Wander Alpha`, and submitted it for external TestFlight review.
- Apple currently reports build `0.1 (8)` beta review state `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`.
- Final App Store Connect check after push: build `0.1 (8)` is `VALID`, `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, and external beta review state is `APPROVED`.

## 2026-06-06 12:57 PDT - Codex - M5 Build 9 Friend Test Batch

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `1af695e`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; worktree clean.

Goal: fix confusing short Google Maps link behavior and prepare a clearer Build 9 friend-test batch.

Plan:

- Try to resolve Google Maps short links by following their HTTPS redirect before falling back.
- If a short link still does not expose a place name, show honest copy that short links need extraction and can be saved as drafts.
- Polish Add link copy so testers understand what works now versus what is queued for backend extraction.
- Keep backend extraction workers out of this batch; M6 owns real extraction execution.
- Run full tests, upload a new TestFlight build, and provide a friend-ready testing message.

Checkpoint:

- Added short-map-link detection for `maps.app.goo.gl`, `goo.gl`, and `g.co`.
- `MapKitPlaceResolver.resolveLink` now follows known short-link HTTPS redirects, reparses the final URL, and then runs MapKit candidate search.
- Checked Joe's screenshot link with `curl -sIL`; it redirects to a full `maps.google.com/maps?q=Tahoe+Waterman's+Landing...` URL, which the parser now covers.
- Added specific short-link fallback copy: "Short map links need extraction. Save this as a draft for now or add it manually."
- Updated Add link helper/button/draft copy so the feature reads as partial support, not broken extraction.
- Added tests for short-link classification, expanded Google Maps redirect destinations, and short-link fallback copy.
- Ran full Xcode tests before and after the build number bump:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed both runs.
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` to `9`, archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build9.xcarchive`, and uploaded build `0.1 (9)`.
- App Store Connect build id for `0.1 (9)`: `c0f30e62-bda5-457b-82f8-a960635f60c7`; processing state `VALID`.
- Set export compliance to `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached build `0.1 (9)` to public group `Wander Alpha`, and submitted it for external TestFlight review.
- Apple currently reports build `0.1 (9)` beta review state `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`.
- Final App Store Connect check after push: build `0.1 (9)` is `VALID`, `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, and external beta review state is `APPROVED`.

- Mission Control remains unreachable on `localhost:4000` (`curl` exit 7), so this repo log is the coordination record.
- gstack preamble reported `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE 1.26.0.0 1.56.0.0`; upgrade was snoozed for this review so the toolchain does not change mid-task.
- gstack design-doc check found no branch-specific design artifact; using the existing Wander product spec, M1.5 contract, M3 backend doc, decisions doc, and current code as review inputs.

Checkpoint:

- Joe paused the M6 review to triage friend TestFlight feedback from Build 9.
- Decision: Build 10 cleanup should happen before M6 because the findings are current-test blockers: Dark Mode contrast, Map search behavior, Add flow escape hatches, and chip/sheet readability.

## 2026-06-06 19:19 PDT - Codex - Build 10 Friend Test Cleanup

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `efc5033`
Starting status: local `main` matched `origin/main`; `docs/agent-log.md` already had the in-progress M6 review entry above from this session.

Goal: implement the pre-M6 Build 10 cleanup from friend screenshots, then provide a QA checklist for Joe/friend testing.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `docs/qa/2026-06-08-build-11-pre-m6-test-checklist.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Plan:

- Force the alpha UI into the approved light theme so Dark Mode cannot make cream surfaces unreadable.
- Make Map search text readable and make keyboard Search run real MapKit candidate search.
- Add visible Add-flow recovery actions: change/search again and back to Add home.
- Reset Add to the home/source picker after leaving the Add tab.
- Replace quick-detail question grid spacing with a wrapping chip layout.
- Add a friend-test QA checklist doc before shipping.

Checkpoint:

- Forced the app into the approved light theme at the root so iOS Dark Mode no longer turns cream-surface text white.
- Wired Map search submit to `store.manualCandidates(...)` so pressing keyboard Search can find unsaved place candidates, show transient pins/sheets, and allow saving them to the user's map.
- Added Map search loading/error state and made search/candidate/sheet text explicitly readable against the warm map and cream surfaces.
- Added Add-flow recovery actions on confirmation/details screens: search/change place and back to Add home.
- Reset Add to source picker when the user leaves the Add tab and returns.
- Replaced Add quick-details `LazyVGrid` chips with a custom wrapping layout to remove spacing holes.
- Added QA checklist, now carried forward at `docs/qa/2026-06-08-build-11-pre-m6-test-checklist.md`.
- Ran full tests:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed before and after the build-number bump/project regeneration.
- Simulator smoke screenshots captured:
  `DerivedData/build10-map-smoke.png`
  `DerivedData/build10-add-smoke.png`
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` to `10`, regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` with `xcodegen generate`, archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build10.xcarchive`, and uploaded build `0.1 (10)`.
- App Store Connect build id for `0.1 (10)`: `128f2b2b-3523-4620-beb5-72bef23ceaa6`; processing state `VALID`.
- Set export compliance to `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached build `0.1 (10)` to public group `Wander Alpha`, and submitted it for external TestFlight review.
- Final App Store Connect check: build `0.1 (10)` is `VALID`, `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, and external beta review state is `APPROVED`.

## 2026-06-08 00:00 PDT - Codex - Build 11 Map Search Scope Fix

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `3f32589`
Starting status: local `main` matched `origin/main`; worktree clean before this log entry.

Goal: fix Joe's Build 10 TestFlight finding that logged-out Map search behaves like global Apple Maps search and shows unsaved candidates as saveable/saved.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `docs/qa/2026-06-08-build-11-pre-m6-test-checklist.md`
- `docs/setup.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Decision:

- Map search must only search places already visible in the user's map graph: own saved places plus visible network places.
- Global place lookup/search belongs in Add, not Map.
- Map may still allow saving a social/network place someone else saved, but it should not create transient global candidates from arbitrary map search text.

Checkpoint:

- Removed the Build 10 transient global Map search candidate path from `MapScreen`.
- Map search now filters only `store.visiblePlaces(filters:)`, covering saved own places and visible network/social places.
- Removed `store.manualCandidates(...)` from Map; that global lookup remains in Add.
- Updated Map search placeholder to `search your map or people...`.
- Updated the QA checklist and renamed it to `docs/qa/2026-06-08-build-11-pre-m6-test-checklist.md`.
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` to `11` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` with `xcodegen generate`.
- First sandboxed test attempt failed from Xcode/CoreSimulator cache permission denial, not code.
- Reran full tests with normal Xcode access:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- Archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build11.xcarchive` and uploaded build `0.1 (11)`.
- App Store Connect build id for `0.1 (11)`: `3d9db598-6cdb-4d49-8cb5-4892de6ff55d`; processing state `VALID`.
- Set export compliance to `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached build `0.1 (11)` to public group `Wander Alpha`, and submitted it for external TestFlight review.
- Final App Store Connect check: build `0.1 (11)` is `VALID`, `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, and external beta review state is `APPROVED`.

## 2026-06-08 17:39 PDT - Codex - Build 12 Add Navigation Cleanup

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `8d1e758`
Starting status: local `main` matched `origin/main`; worktree clean before this log entry.

Goal: remove redundant Add-flow recovery buttons because the upper-left back control is the intended navigation escape.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `docs/qa/2026-06-08-build-11-pre-m6-test-checklist.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Decision:

- Remove the `try a different link` / `back to add` recovery row from Add confirmation.
- Remove the `change place` / `back to add` recovery row from Add details.
- Keep the upper-left back button as the single back affordance inside Add.

Checkpoint:

- Removed both `RecoveryActionsRow` usages from Add confirmation/details.
- Removed the now-unused `RecoveryActionsRow` view, `AddSourceType.searchAgainTitle`, and `returnToSearchForCurrentSource()`.
- Updated the QA checklist to verify the extra buttons are absent and the upper-left back control handles navigation.
- Ran full tests:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: passed.
- No separate TestFlight upload for this micro-cleanup yet; include it in the next M6/TestFlight build unless Joe asks for an immediate build.

## 2026-06-08 17:44 PDT - Codex - M6 Extraction Job Enqueue And Nearby Ranking

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `a39e3ed`
Starting status: local `main` matched `origin/main`; worktree clean before this log entry.

Goal: start M6 by making extraction drafts enqueue real remote jobs when signed in, and fix the current-location candidate quality issue Joe saw in TestFlight.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Services/MapKitPlaceResolver.swift`
- `Wander/Services/RepositoryProtocols.swift`
- `Wander/App/WanderBackend.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Remote/SupabaseRepositories.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `supabase/migrations/*`
- `supabase/tests/*`
- `WanderTests/*`
- `docs/*`

Plan:

- Add a Supabase RPC to idempotently upsert `source_artifacts` and `extraction_jobs`.
- Add an iOS extraction repository around that RPC.
- Keep link/photo drafts local-first, then mark artifact/job synced or failed after remote enqueue.
- Improve current-location candidate ranking with closer radius first and distance/category-aware sorting.
- Keep extraction execution itself queued/pending; do not fake AI extraction or auto-save low confidence.

Checkpoint:

- Mission Control task creation failed because `http://localhost:4000` was unreachable from this session. Continuing with `docs/agent-log.md` as the coordination surface.
- Added `supabase/migrations/20260608174400_enqueue_extraction_job.sql` for the public/app `enqueue_extraction_job` RPC.
- Hosted pgTAP caught an ambiguous PL/pgSQL variable/column reference in the first function body.
- Added `supabase/migrations/20260608175500_fix_enqueue_extraction_job_variable.sql` with `v_` variable names and repushed.
- Added `supabase/tests/extraction_jobs.sql`; hosted pgTAP now passes `15 + 14 + 9 = 38` assertions across RLS, Clerk mirroring, and extraction enqueue tests.
- Added iOS `ExtractionRepository` contract plus `SupabaseExtractionRepository`.
- Signed-in link/photo unresolved drafts now enqueue remote extraction jobs and mark local source/job rows synced or failed.
- Improved `I'm here now` MapKit candidate ranking by searching a tight radius first and sorting by POI/category/distance.
- Important scope note: extraction job execution is still not implemented. Build 12 queues jobs only.

Completion:

- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Swift tests passed before and after XcodeGen/build bump:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Build number bumped to `0.1 (12)` in `project.yml` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj`.
- Archived and uploaded `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build12.xcarchive`.
- App Store Connect build id: `b2ae0178-8d35-40a8-a4be-80c31cd1ce3b`.
- Build `0.1 (12)` is `VALID`, export compliance is `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached to `Wander Alpha`, and external TestFlight review is `APPROVED`.
- Public TestFlight link remains `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`.
- Next M6 work: implement the backend worker/provider adapters that consume queued `extraction_jobs` and write candidate results without auto-saving low-confidence places.

## 2026-06-08 19:31 PDT - Codex - M6 Extraction Worker And Result Polling

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `bb74fac`
Starting status: local `main` matched `origin/main`; worktree clean before this log entry.

Goal: continue M6 by adding the worker/result path after Build 12's extraction enqueue foundation.

Expected files to touch:

- `supabase/functions/*`
- `supabase/migrations/*`
- `supabase/tests/*`
- `Wander/Services/RepositoryProtocols.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Remote/SupabaseRepositories.swift`
- `Wander/App/WanderBackend.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `WanderTests/*`
- `docs/*`

Plan:

- Add service-role RPCs for safely claiming pending extraction jobs and completing/failing them.
- Add a Supabase Edge Function worker with conservative adapters: Google Maps/link/web text metadata first; photo remains a no-place/manual fallback until OCR storage is wired.
- Expose an authenticated app RPC to fetch extraction job results.
- Add iOS repository/store polling so a draft can become confirmable candidates without auto-saving.
- Keep low-confidence/no-place results as drafts with manual rescue.

Note:

- Mission Control task creation failed again because `http://localhost:4000` is unreachable in this session.

Checkpoint:

- Added `supabase/migrations/20260608193200_extraction_worker_rpcs.sql` with authenticated claim/get RPCs and service-role claim-next/complete RPCs.
- Hosted pgTAP initially caught missing execute grants for authenticated helper payload functions.
- Added `supabase/migrations/20260608194600_fix_extraction_worker_helper_grants.sql`.
- Hosted pgTAP now passes `15 + 14 + 16 = 45` assertions across RLS, Clerk mirroring, and extraction jobs.
- Added `supabase/functions/extraction-worker/index.ts` plus its import map and deployed it to project `rugmtlgufrhlxwfkumhw`.
- Live endpoint smoke without auth returns `401 missing_authorization`, confirming the deployed function is reachable and enforcing the app-triggered auth path.
- Added iOS Edge Function invocation support, extraction process/result repository methods, store result application, and Add-flow transition from processed coordinate-backed link results into the existing confirmation screen.
- Guardrail: extracted candidates without coordinates are not shown as saveable candidates in Add; unsupported/photo sources remain drafts.

Completion:

- Attempted to set explicit `WANDER_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` fallback secret, but the CLI command hung and was terminated. The deployed worker still reads standard `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` first, so this is not blocking Build 13.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Swift tests passed:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Hosted pgTAP passed:
  - `supabase/tests/rls_visibility.sql`: 15 assertions
  - `supabase/tests/clerk_profile_mirroring.sql`: 14 assertions
  - `supabase/tests/extraction_jobs.sql`: 16 assertions
- Supabase migrations applied to hosted project:
  - `20260608193200_extraction_worker_rpcs.sql`
  - `20260608194600_fix_extraction_worker_helper_grants.sql`
- Deployed Edge Function `extraction-worker`; unauthenticated smoke returns `401 missing_authorization`.
- Build number bumped to `0.1 (13)` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj`.
- Archived and uploaded `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build13.xcarchive`.
- App Store Connect build id: `727d0ab0-be96-4d81-8840-385c81f438bb`.
- Build `0.1 (13)` is `VALID`, export compliance is `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached to `Wander Alpha`, and external TestFlight review is `APPROVED`.
- Public TestFlight link remains `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`.
- Remaining M6 work: improve Google Maps/short-link robustness after real test results, add photo OCR/Vision, add TikTok/Instagram fallback adapters, add scheduled/background worker run, and finish alpha analytics/privacy/performance.

## 2026-06-08 20:15 PDT - Codex - Map User Location And Search Result Pins

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `a80ab94`
Starting status: local `main` matched `origin/main`; worktree clean before this log entry.

Goal: fix Map behavior from Joe's feedback: show the user's location, add recenter control, allow Map search to surface unsaved MapKit POI results distinctly, hide plus on already-saved own places, and provide an edit/mark-been affordance for saved own places.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `WanderTests/*`
- `docs/*`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Decisions:

- MapKit supports POI search via `MKLocalSearch`; use that for explicit Map search result pins.
- Do not rely on tapping Apple's built-in POI labels in SwiftUI Map for this pass.
- Search result pins are temporary unsaved candidates and must look different from saved/social pins.
- Plus appears for unsaved search results and social places not already saved by the current user.
- Plus is hidden for places already on the current user's map; own saved places get an edit-style action.

Checkpoint:

- Added `UserAnnotation()` to Map and a custom recenter button that uses `.userLocation(fallback:)`.
- Added `MKLocalSearch` on Map search submit, scoped to the current camera region.
- Unsaved MapKit search results render as distinct dashed/yellow pins and use a separate sheet with `not saved yet` copy.
- Search-result `+` saves the candidate to the current user's map as `wanna`.
- Saved own places no longer show `+`; they show an edit/pencil action.
- Social places show `+` only when the current user has not already saved that place.
- Own saved `wanna` places can be marked `been` through the edit action; full edit sheet remains future work.
- Added `docs/qa/2026-06-08-build-14-map-search-location-checklist.md`.
- Swift tests passed:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`

Completion:

- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Swift tests passed again after bumping to Build 14 and regenerating the project.
- Build number bumped to `0.1 (14)` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj`.
- Archived and uploaded `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build14.xcarchive`.
- App Store Connect build id: `86743675-f9b9-4d5f-b51b-2efb612df992`.
- Build `0.1 (14)` is `VALID`, export compliance is `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached to `Wander Alpha`, and external TestFlight review is `APPROVED`.
- Public TestFlight link remains `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`.

## 2026-06-08 20:37 PDT - Codex - Map Recenter Zoom And Park Category Fix

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `43664d5`
Starting status: worktree clean before this log entry. Mission Control localhost task create failed because `localhost:4000` was not reachable.

Goal: apply Joe's map feedback after Build 14: make the recenter control blue and bottom-right, recenter with a useful zoom around the user's current coordinate, make unsaved search result pins blue, and fix MapKit parks being categorized as hikes.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Profile/ProfileScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/MapKitPlaceResolver.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderPlaceCategory.swift`
- `WanderTests/WanderPlaceCategoryTests.swift`
- `docs/qa/2026-06-08-build-15-map-recenter-park-checklist.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `docs/setup.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Decision:

- Preserve MapKit `.park` and `.nationalPark` as Wander category `park`; the previous Map-screen search-only switch incorrectly collapsed parks into `hike`.
- Centralize MapKit-to-Wander category/icon mapping in `WanderPlaceCategory` so Map search, current-location add, manual add, Discover, and Profile stay aligned.
- Recenter uses an explicit current CoreLocation lookup and a fixed camera distance instead of `MapCameraPosition.userLocation`, because `userLocation` does not expose a stable app-defined zoom level.

Checkpoint:

- Added `WanderPlaceCategory` helper and park regression tests.
- Moved recenter control to the lower-right map chrome above the selected sheet.
- Changed recenter control and unsaved search-result pins to use the existing sky/pin-social blue.
- Added recenter zoom to a fixed 1.5km camera distance when current location is available, with a zoomed LA fallback.

Completion:

- `xcodegen generate`: passed.
- First Swift test run caught one stale reference to the removed private category mapper in current-location ranking; replaced it with `WanderPlaceCategory.primary(for:)`.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Swift tests passed:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Build number bumped to `0.1 (15)` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj`.
- Archived and uploaded `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build15.xcarchive`.
- App Store Connect build id: `2043c8e6-4972-4cbf-9de2-6e71d25af235`.
- Build `0.1 (15)` is `VALID`, export compliance is `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached to `Wander Alpha`, and external TestFlight review is `APPROVED`.
- Public TestFlight link remains `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`.

## 2026-06-08 20:58 PDT - Codex - Map Search Typeahead

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `51a7231`
Starting status: worktree clean before this log entry. Mission Control localhost task create failed because `localhost:4000` was not reachable.

Goal: add typeahead suggestions to the Map search bar so short prefixes like `MCD` surface matching places such as McDonald's before submit.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `WanderTests/*` if logic is extracted enough to test directly
- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `docs/qa/*`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Initial approach:

- Keep saved/network matches first because Map search is still primarily the user's trusted map.
- Add debounced MapKit-backed suggestions for unsaved nearby POIs after at least two characters.
- Tapping a suggestion should run the same selection/search behavior as submit, rather than creating a second save path.

Completion:

- Added Map search typeahead with saved/network matches first and debounced MapKit POI suggestions after two characters.
- Tapping a saved/network suggestion selects and centers the existing saved/social pin.
- Tapping an unsaved MapKit suggestion centers the map, shows the blue unsaved pin, and opens the existing unsaved-result sheet with `+`.
- Added `docs/qa/2026-06-08-build-16-map-typeahead-checklist.md`.
- `xcodegen generate`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Swift tests passed:
  `xcodebuild -quiet test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Build number bumped to `0.1 (16)` and regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj`.
- Archived and uploaded `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build16.xcarchive`.
- App Store Connect build id: `9a98cbc5-8988-4952-9765-54e8f55d513d`.
- Build `0.1 (16)` is `VALID`, export compliance is `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached to `Wander Alpha`, and external TestFlight review is `APPROVED`.
- Public TestFlight link remains `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`.

## 2026-06-09 11:18 PDT - Codex - Rich Place Profile Sheet

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `15473c0`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: implement Joe's no-billing rich place profile direction for the Map selected-place sheet: Beli/Slate-inspired expanded profile, social proof, share, Google Maps directions, own captured answers, friend notes/reviews, and no empty metadata rows for data we cannot actually deliver.

Coordination:

- Spawned read-only subagent Maxwell to inspect `MapScreen.swift` integration points and SwiftUI gotchas.
- Spawned read-only subagent Averroes to audit current metadata availability and no-billing docs/QA implications.
- Keep code implementation local because `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift` is conflict-prone.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/PlaceExternalLinks.swift`
- `WanderTests/PlaceExternalLinksTests.swift`
- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/open-questions.md`
- `docs/qa/*`
- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Checkpoint:

- Added `PlaceExternalLinks` for keyless Google Maps directions/search/share URLs; no Google SDK/API key or paid place metadata provider is introduced.
- Reworked the selected Map `PlaceSheet` expanded state into a scrollable place profile: hero, social proof, share icon, directions action, real place facts, "your save", and friend save cards.
- The expanded profile only renders fields Wander actually has. It intentionally omits website, phone, hours, cuisine, order, ratings, and photos until a free/source-owned data path exists.
- Removed the Map profile sheet's fake `Los Angeles` fallback when locality/address is missing.
- Added `PlaceExternalLinksTests` and `docs/qa/2026-06-09-build-17-rich-place-profile-checklist.md`.
- Updated `docs/decisions.md` and `docs/open-questions.md` with the no-billing/no-empty metadata constraint.
- `xcodegen generate`: passed.
- Initial sandboxed `xcodebuild test` failed on CoreSimulator/SwiftPM cache permissions, not app code.
- Escalated Swift tests passed, then passed again after bumping build number to `0.1 (17)`.
- Archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build17.xcarchive` successfully.
- Uploaded build `0.1 (17)` to App Store Connect.

Completion:

- App Store Connect build id: `4d38f9a2-e228-4842-bd97-1da5acd4e3fd`.
- Build `0.1 (17)` is `VALID`, export compliance is `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached to `Wander Alpha`, and external TestFlight review is `APPROVED`.
- Public TestFlight link remains `https://testflight.apple.com/join/knEhRa6t`.
- Remaining follow-up: remote visible-place attributes still need hydration into the expanded profile; local saves and fixture-backed social saves show their answer chips now.

## 2026-06-09 12:02 PDT - Codex - Build 17 Feedback Triage

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `d35b0fc`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: triage Joe/friend Build 17 feedback before implementation: user location dot color, typeahead keyboard behavior, plus/edit flow semantics, sync failed after Add, follow graph visibility, in-memory persistence, celebratory save completion, and future share/deep-link/web landing behavior.

Findings:

- Persistence loss after app kill is expected in the current implementation but not acceptable for alpha: `WanderApp` still injects `WanderModelContainer.preview`, whose `ModelConfiguration` is `isStoredInMemoryOnly: true`, and `WanderStore` is currently array-backed rather than hydrated from SwiftData on launch.
- Follow/unfollow RPCs exist, but relationship reads/followers/following joined profile reads are still partly local or not implemented. Following can appear broken because local follow state is not reliably rehydrated, remote relationship metadata is not fully returned to the UI, and remote visible places may not refresh with relationship context after follow.
- Add-tab save can show `sync failed` while the place still appears on the map because the app performs local-first save, then marks remote sync failed if `save_own_place` rejects/fails. That is a bug to debug if the network/auth path is healthy.
- Typeahead selection does not explicitly dismiss keyboard today.
- Map plus on unsaved/social places saves directly as `wanna` with default visibility; it does not currently route through the Add confirmation/details/questions flow.
- The edit pencil mostly marks `wanna` as `been` or shows "editing saved places is coming next"; full edit/details is not implemented.

## 2026-06-09 12:03 PDT - Codex - Durable Local Persistence

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `412e355`
Starting status: one untracked file was already present: `Wander/Services/WanderStorePersistence.swift`.

Goal: execute the next highest-risk alpha fix from Build 17 feedback: make saved places, follows/blocks, drafts, source artifacts, extraction jobs, attributes, and default visibility survive app kill/relaunch.

Remaining work list from latest triage:

- Durable local persistence for saves/follows/drafts.
- Follow graph reliability: relationship refresh, remote profile/following/follower reads, and social places appearing after follow.
- Add-tab `sync failed` diagnosis.
- Map typeahead keyboard dismissal after selecting a result.
- Map plus should enter the Add-style confirmation/details flow for unsaved places instead of direct-saving incomplete metadata.
- Real edit flow for saved places: status, visibility, answers, notes.
- Save success should be a short celebratory toast/haptic/add-another moment, not a full-screen success state.
- Map user location dot should use Apple Maps-style blue.
- Place profile cleanup: address should not appear as a chip.
- Remote visible-place attribute hydration into the expanded place profile.
- Later share/deep-link/web landing page.
- M6 extraction hardening: Google Maps robustness, generic web metadata, photo OCR, TikTok/Instagram.
- Alpha readiness: privacy copy, onboarding/auth gates, analytics provider, performance/QA.

- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- Reused and completed the existing untracked `WanderStorePersistence.swift` as a JSON snapshot store under Application Support.
- Live fixture mode now injects `WanderStorePersistence.live`; demo fixture mode remains non-persistent.
- `WanderStore` now restores saved places, user places, attributes, follows, blocks, drafts, source artifacts, extraction jobs, current profile, and default visibility from disk.
- Added persistence calls around local save, draft, follow, block, sync-marking, profile-shell, and extraction-job mutations.
- Added relaunch tests covering saved place answers/default visibility and social graph/draft restore.
- `xcodegen generate`: passed.
- Initial sandboxed test run failed from CoreSimulator/SwiftPM cache permissions only.
- Focused `WanderStoreTests`: passed with elevated `xcodebuild`.
- Full test suite: passed with elevated `xcodebuild`.

Completion:

- Commit `e15da72` (`fix: persist local wander state`) pushed to `origin/main`.
- Next restart point: map typeahead keyboard dismissal, then Add-style plus/edit flow.

## 2026-06-09 12:32 PDT - Codex - Map Save/Edit Flow

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `8c26a11`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: replace Map direct-save/placeholder edit behavior with a real save/edit sheet that captures the same core data as Add: been/wanna, visibility, category-specific question answers, and note.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddQuestionTemplates.swift`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- Extracted Add category question templates into shared `Wander/Features/Add/AddQuestionTemplates.swift`.
- Map unsaved result `+` now opens a save sheet with status, visibility, category-specific answers, and note instead of direct-saving.
- Map social place `+` now opens the same save sheet; final save still requires sign-in for social saves.
- Map saved-place pencil now opens the same flow prefilled with existing status, visibility, note, and answer attributes.
- The flow updates saved places through `WanderStore.saveCandidate`, so persistence/sync state paths remain shared.
- `xcodegen generate`: passed.
- Full test suite passed with elevated `xcodebuild`.

Completion:

- Commit `a71a909` (`feat: add map save edit flow`) pushed to `origin/main`.

## 2026-06-09 15:17 PDT - Codex - Build 21 Social Graph And Save Questions

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `fa71dad`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: finish the next alpha batch instead of asking Joe to test partial social graph behavior: make best-for fields multi-select, make rating chips emoji-based, make save success quieter/short-lived, and wire the remaining remote social graph list/relationship hydration path.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Add/AddQuestionTemplates.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/App/WanderBackend.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Remote/*`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `WanderTests/*`
- `supabase/migrations/*`
- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Checkpoint:

- Mission Control was not reachable on `localhost:4000`; repo coordination is captured here.
- Clarification for Joe: "remote" in this repo means backend/Supabase data, distinct from local fixtures or local-only saves.
- Save question templates now use emoji rating chips for "how much did you like it?" and make restaurant/bar/park "best for?" multi-select; existing tags remain multi-select.
- Add save success auto-dismisses faster; sync/sign-in-needed messages stay visible a bit longer because they are actionable.
- Map "Added to your map" / "Updated saved place" messages now clear after 2 seconds instead of sticking in the search message slot.
- Added Supabase migration `20260609211700_social_graph_rpcs.sql` for `profile_followers`, `profile_following`, and `profile_relationship`.
- Wired the new graph RPCs through `SupabaseFollowRepository`, `WanderBackend`, and `WanderStore.refreshRemoteSocialGraph`.
- Profile and graph list screens now refresh backend graph data when opened.
- Full `xcodebuild test`: passed before packaging.
- Applied hosted Supabase migration with `npx supabase db push --linked --yes`.
- Verified local/remote migration list includes `20260609211700`.

Completion:

- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` to `21` in `project.yml`.
- Regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` with `xcodegen generate`.
- Full `xcodebuild test`: passed again after project generation.
- Commit `ffa678d` (`feat: hydrate social graph`) pushed to `origin/main`.
- Archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build21.xcarchive`.
- Uploaded build `0.1 (21)` to App Store Connect.
- App Store Connect build id: `a98d8c29-2156-4971-befd-fda8c2bb1bc8`.

## 2026-06-09 12:58 PDT - Codex - Build 20 Social Reliability Batch

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `b15b637`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: batch the next alpha reliability fixes before the next TestFlight: keep social places refreshed after follow graph mutations, wire profile-specific remote places, hydrate remote answer attributes for richer place sheets, make Add success less like a full-screen dead end, then test/package.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/App/WanderBackend.swift`
- `Wander/Services/DiscoverModels.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Remote/SupabaseDTOs.swift`
- `Wander/Services/Remote/SupabaseRepositories.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`

- `Wander/Features/Profile/ProfileScreen.swift`
- `WanderTests/*`
- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- Mission Control was not reachable on `localhost:4000`; repo coordination is captured here.
- Remote visible place DTOs now preserve answer attributes into `VisiblePlace.attributes`.
- Store refresh now hydrates remote profile shells and answer attributes so place sheets/social saves can read returned answers.
- Remote social filtering now trusts backend-authorized rows for following/social scopes while still honoring local block state; Friends also admits backend mutuals-only rows.
- Follow/unfollow/block/unblock now trigger a broad remote place refresh after backend success.
- `profile_visible_places` is wired through the Supabase user-place repository and Profile detail refreshes on open/after follow changes.
- Add save now returns to the Add source screen and shows a compact saved/sync-state toast with haptic feedback instead of the old full-screen success page.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Full `xcodebuild test`: passed.

Completion:

- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` to `20` in `project.yml`.
- Regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` with `xcodegen generate`.
- Full `xcodebuild test`: passed again after project generation.
- Commit `caa40f1` (`feat: refresh social place data`) pushed to `origin/main`.
- Archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build20.xcarchive`.

Starting commit: `a71a909`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: package persistence, Map keyboard dismissal, and Map save/edit flow into TestFlight build `0.1 (19)`.

- `project.yml`
- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

## 2026-06-09 15:44 PDT - Codex - Discover Place Row Detail Fix

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `31e2dfd`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: fix Discover place rows so tapping a place opens a design-compliant place detail surface instead of the saver profile, while keeping profile access secondary inside the place card.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion:

- Discover place rows now open a place detail sheet instead of jumping directly to the saver profile.
- Saver/profile access remains available from the place detail sheet.
- The Discover plus action is hidden for places already saved by the current user.
- The new place sheet mirrors the Map sheet style and only shows metadata currently available without paid/billing-backed APIs: category, address/locality, directions, share, saved-by context, note, and saved answer chips.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Full elevated `xcodebuild test`: passed, 80 tests.
- Commit `1722197` (`fix: open discover places as place details`) pushed to `origin/main`.
- Bumped `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` to `22` in `project.yml`.
- Regenerated `Wander.xcodeproj` with `xcodegen generate`.

## 2026-06-09 16:24 PDT - Codex - Build 23 Map Detail Fixes

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `4d3bf63`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: ship the pre-place-profile fixes Joe requested: tap empty map to clear selection, remove address chips from place facts, keep selected save notes visible in expanded place cards, and investigate the followers-visible place report before changing the richer profile design.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `WanderTests/*` if a focused regression test is practical
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Scoped plan-eng-review notes:

- No design doc found for this branch; skipped /office-hours because this is a narrow bugfix batch and Joe explicitly asked to do these fixes before the larger place-profile change.
- Step 0 scope: keep website/order/Google reviews out of this patch. Official Google Places docs put reviews in paid Places API field tiers, so no-billing alpha should not depend on Google reviews.
- Existing code reused: `PlaceSheet`, `DiscoverPlaceDetailSheet`, `VisiblePlace.note`, `saveSummaries(for:)`, `PlaceExternalLinks`, MapKit-backed candidates, and Supabase visible-place RPCs.
- NOT in scope: Beli-style rich place profile, website/call/order fields, Google reviews, and new paid Places integration.

Checkpoint:

- Removed address from place fact chips in Map and Discover place detail sheets while keeping address/locality in subtitle text.
- Changed Map empty-tap behavior so tapping away from selected pins/candidates clears the selected sheet instead of leaving stale selection active.
- Kept selected save notes visible in expanded Map place sheets, attributed the note owner in Map and Discover, and made Map save-summary aggregation use all authorized saves for that place instead of only currently filtered/search-visible rows.
- Added a focused store test assertion that backend-authorized remote social/following rows keep their notes after hydration.
- Added `TODOS.md` guidance for the richer place-profile action bar: Directions can be generated from coordinates; Website/Call/Order require real supplied data and should be hidden when absent; Google reviews are not a no-billing alpha dependency.

Completion:

- Scoped `/plan-eng-review` result: this was a narrow bugfix/release batch, not a new architecture change. Website/Call/Order stays in the next richer place-profile data pass and must hide absent actions.
- Follower visibility investigation: app policy and Supabase RLS already say a follower can read `followers`/Everyone places; the live report is most likely a missing remote follow edge, failed local-only save/sync, stale refresh, or viewport mismatch rather than an intended rule. Added client regression coverage for remote social/following notes.
- Official Google Places docs put `reviews` in a paid field tier, so Google reviews are not part of the no-billing alpha path.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Full elevated `xcodebuild test`: passed, 80 tests.
- Full elevated `xcodebuild test` after build-number regeneration: passed, 80 tests.
- Commit `7357efe` (`fix: polish place detail map interactions`) pushed to `origin/main`.
- Commit `704c6a9` (`chore: bump wander build 23`) pushed to `origin/main`.
- Archived `/private/tmp/Wander-0.1-build23.xcarchive`.
- Uploaded build `0.1 (23)` to App Store Connect.
- App Store Connect build id: `2964e3eb-fdc7-428a-b7f7-eafefefa182d`.
- Build `0.1 (23)` is `VALID`, export compliance is `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, attached to `Wander Alpha`, and external TestFlight review is `APPROVED`.

## 2026-06-09 17:00 PDT - Codex - Rec.me TestFlight Slack Protocol

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `42a517d`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: make it durable that every future TestFlight build post includes a Slack update in the rec.me feedback channel, and send the Build 23 testing note now.

Expected files to touch:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Slack channel lookup:

- `#testflight-feedback` (`C0BAA7DG2AC`) is the rec.me TestFlight feedback channel.
- `#all-recme` (`C0B9FU1QNG2`) exists for broader rec.me announcements, but TestFlight build notes should go to `#testflight-feedback`.

Completion:

- Updated `AGENTS.md` to name Rec.me as the product name, keep Wander as the former/repo name, and require every future TestFlight build to post release notes to `#testflight-feedback`.
- Slack Build 23 release/testing note posted to `#testflight-feedback`: `https://recmegroup.slack.com/archives/C0BAA7DG2AC/p1781049362472419`.
- No app tests run; this was documentation plus Slack communication only.

Follow-up:

- Joe asked for recurring polling of `#testflight-feedback` for bugs/issues, with `:airplane_departure:` when triage starts and `:white_check_mark:` when done, plus scoped `plan-eng-review` / `plan-design-review` in a standalone/new-chat context when necessary.
- Attempted to create an hourly Codex automation, but the app returned `No handler registered for tool: automation_update`; recurring job was not saved from this session.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with the full manual/automation protocol so future agents can execute it and create the automation once the handler is available.

Immediate poll:

- Found Ryan's Build 23 feedback in `#testflight-feedback`: `https://recmegroup.slack.com/archives/C0BAA7DG2AC/p1781051088761659`.
- Report: "The tap in and tap away is a little buggy. When I zoom out, sometimes i have to tap twice to select or unselect the pin"
- Added `:airplane_departure:` reaction before triage.
- Initial classification: engineering bug/regression in MapKit tap hit-testing/selection clearing, not a design review issue unless the fix changes the interaction model.
- Triage recommendation posted in-thread: `https://recmegroup.slack.com/archives/C0BAA7DG2AC/p1781074371972679?thread_ts=1781051088.761659&cid=C0BAA7DG2AC`.
- Added `:white_check_mark:` reaction after triage.
- Added the issue to `TODOS.md` as a P1 Build 23 Map tap hit-testing regression.

## 2026-06-09 17:08 PDT - Codex - Collaboration PR Workflow

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `c7a6c75`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: update repo agent instructions so Joe, Ryan, and agents coordinate through short-lived branches, worktrees when useful, and PR handoffs.

Expected files to touch:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion:

- Added `Collaboration And Git Workflow` guidance to `AGENTS.md`.
- Documented branch prefixes for Joe, Ryan, Codex, Claude, and OpenClaw.
- Added explicit instruction that Ryan-owned feature/fix/change sessions should push `ryan/<short-task>` branches and open or update a draft/ready PR before stopping, unless Ryan explicitly says not to push or open a PR.
- No app tests run; this was documentation/process only.

## 2026-06-09 17:24 PDT - Codex - Slack Triage Reply Correction

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `7993c13`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: correct the TestFlight feedback triage protocol so agents do not reply in Slack during triage; Slack should only get reactions unless Joe explicitly asks otherwise. Triage analysis and recommendations should happen in Codex/new standalone threads.

Expected files to touch:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion:

- Updated `AGENTS.md` triage rules: use `:airplane_departure:` and `:white_check_mark:` reactions only, do not post Slack triage replies by default, and surface analysis/questions/recommendations in Codex.
- No app tests run; this was documentation/process only.

## 2026-06-10 00:00 PDT - Codex - App Store Build Increment Rule

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `a199184`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: make the App Store/TestFlight build-number bump rule durable for all agents working in rec.me.

Expected files to touch:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion:

- Added `AGENTS.md` instructions requiring any `main` update intended for App Store Connect/TestFlight to increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.yml`, run `xcodegen generate`, commit `project.yml` plus `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, and log the build number/upload status.
- Clarified that docs-only/process-only commits do not need a build bump unless they are being packaged into a new TestFlight/App Store build.
- No app tests run; this was documentation/process only.

## 2026-06-10 00:03 PDT - Codex - Remove Manual Feedback Polling

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `b4fc05b`
Starting status: worktree clean.

Goal: remove manual Slack feedback polling instructions from `AGENTS.md`; TestFlight feedback triage should be handled by a recurring automation instead of every agent polling the channel.

Expected files to touch:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion:

- Removed the `TestFlight Feedback Triage` section from `AGENTS.md`.
- Kept the TestFlight release-note rule for actual build uploads/availability confirmations.
- No app tests run; this was documentation/process only.
