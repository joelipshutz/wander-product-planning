# Agent Log

This is the shared work log for all agents and developers working in this repo.

Rules:

- Add an entry before non-trivial work starts.
- Add checkpoints during long work or when direction changes.
- Add a completion/handoff entry with tests, commits, known issues, and next steps.
- Mention dirty worktree changes you did not make. Do not revert them without explicit instruction.
- Keep entries concrete enough that another agent can resume without reading the whole chat.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex - Morning Reset, M2 Local Loop, Handoff Docs

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Status at start of this log entry: local `main` matched `origin/main` at `962efce`, with one uncommitted Xcode project signing/team diff in `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.

### What Happened

- Joe asked to audit/reset earlier low-pass implementation work and redo from a stronger plan.
- Low-pass native implementation was reset in commit `c3ac87f`.
- Audited plan/docs were locked in:
  - `7f12630 docs: lock reset audit contract`
  - `7edbea2 docs: complete m2 design gate`
- Rebuilt the native foundation and M2 local product loop:
  - `3b109ad feat: rebuild audited ios foundation`
  - `962efce feat: build local m2 product loop`
- Pushed `962efce` to GitHub `main`.
- Verified with `xcodebuild test`; latest successful run had 18 tests and 0 failures.

### M2 Implementation Summary

Built locally with deterministic fixtures:

- Four tabs: Map, Add, Discover, Profile.
- Settings from Profile gear only.
- MapKit map with seeded own/social pins and filters.
- Add flow with current-location/manual save, visibility picker, contextual questions, and honest link/photo unresolved drafts.
- Discover with smart filters, username/profile lookup, contacts-shaped UI, and social save.
- Profile/settings with follow/unfollow/block, followers/following lists, default visibility, blocked users, drafts, and local sync hints.
- `WanderStore` manages seeded local state, visibility filtering, follow/block behavior, discover parsing, drafts, and saves.

### Tests Run

Known successful command:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Result:

```text
18 tests, 0 failures
```

Coverage includes token values, tab navigation, visibility policy, sync state transitions, deterministic Discover parser, save merge behavior, drafts, profile search, block behavior, current-location metadata, and graph edge lists.

### Current Known Issue

Joe shared a simulator screenshot showing the M2 Map screen looks bad:

- App content is undersized/letterboxed inside the iPhone simulator.
- Map does not fill and orient naturally to the device screen.
- Search, chips, selected place sheet, and tab bar are too large/crowded.
- Bottom sheet and tab bar compete for vertical space.

Next implementation task: fix root/Map layout sizing and safe areas first, then sweep Add/Discover/Profile/Settings.

### Dirty Worktree Caveat

There is an uncommitted generated Xcode project diff:

- `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Observed contents look like local Xcode signing/team churn, including `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Y7TVK75RZ8` and an `explicitFileType` change for `Wander.app`.

Do not include this in docs or UI commits unless Joe explicitly wants local signing settings committed.

### Token/Usage Sketch For The Morning

Exact token/billing usage is not visible inside the repo or terminal. Qualitatively, the morning spent a lot of context on:

- Reconstructing product decisions from the long thread.
- Running plan/design/engineering review workflows and writing durable specs.
- Rebuilding the native SwiftUI app foundation.
- Implementing the M2 local product loop across Map, Add, Discover, Profile, Settings, models, services, and tests.
- Iterating through Xcode build/test failures and long compiler logs.
- Verifying GitHub `main` and pushing commits.
- Diagnosing the simulator screenshot and creating this catch-up/handoff package.

The highest-token sinks were likely long repository/document reads, Swift/Xcode build output, multi-file diffs, and the large planning/spec context.

### Disk Space Note

While creating this handoff, the machine had only about 100 MB free on `/System/Volumes/Data`. Clearing generated Xcode build artifacts freed enough space:

- Removed repo-local `DerivedData`.
- Cleared global Xcode DerivedData cache under `/Users/joelipshutz/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`.

These were generated build caches, not source files.

### Next Steps

1. Commit the handoff docs and agent log rules.
2. Fix M2 native UI sizing/layout, starting with Map/root safe-area behavior.
3. Run build/tests.
4. Capture simulator screenshots if possible.
5. Commit and push the visual fix.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex - M2 Native UI Sizing Fix

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `c452297`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has an unstaged local signing/team diff that should remain untouched unless Joe asks.

Goal: fix the simulator screenshot failure where the M2 Map UI is letterboxed/undersized and controls are crowded. Start by inspecting app/root launch configuration, safe-area handling, and Map screen layout. Then patch the smallest stable surface, run tests, capture screenshots if possible, commit, and push.

Expected files to inspect/touch:

- `Wander/Resources/Info.plist`
- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/DesignSystem/WanderTheme.swift`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- `Wander/Resources/Info.plist` had no launch-screen declaration. Added `UILaunchScreen` and portrait orientation, which should remove iOS compatibility letterboxing on modern simulators.
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift` was tightened for native scale: full-screen map ignores safe areas, smaller search bar, smaller map filter chips, smaller pins, and a more compact selected place sheet.

Completion checkpoint, 2026-06-01 11:28 PDT:

- Ran the full test suite after the sizing patch:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

- Result: 18 tests, 0 failures.
- Captured simulator screenshots:
  - `DerivedData/wander-map-after-final-iphone16plus.png`
  - `DerivedData/wander-map-after-final-iphone16e.png`
- Visual result: the iOS letterboxing/undersized app frame is fixed on both targets. Map now fills the screen. Search, chips, pins, and selected-place sheet are materially more compact. On smaller phones the filter chips remain horizontally scrollable by design.
- Remaining local caveat: `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has an unstaged local signing/team diff that was not part of this work and should remain uncommitted unless Joe explicitly wants it.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex - M2.1 Visual QA Sweep

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `32e3edc`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: sweep the remaining M2 native screens after the Map letterboxing fix. Capture/navigate Add, Discover, Profile, Settings, and related profile/list/draft states where practical; patch obvious sizing, safe-area, truncation, and density issues; run tests; commit and push.

Expected files to inspect/touch:

- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Profile/ProfileScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Settings/SettingsScreen.swift`
- `Wander/DesignSystem/WanderTheme.swift`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion checkpoint, 2026-06-01 15:28 PDT:

- Added QA launch arguments in `WanderRootView`:
  - `-WanderInitialTab add|discover|profile`
  - `-WanderOpenSettings`
- Compact visual sweep:
  - Add: reduced row/card height, icon size, header/subtitle scale, and draft/saved state bulk.
  - Discover: reduced header/search density, people card height, smart-filter height, and place-row padding.
  - Profile: reduced owner card, stat tiles, month card, empty rows, and recent rows.
  - Settings: reduced row/card density and fixed visibility/blocked cards shrinking to content width.
- Captured screenshots under `DerivedData/visual-sweep/`:
  - iPhone 16 Plus: Add, Discover, Profile, Settings.
  - iPhone 16e: Add, Discover, Profile, Settings.
- Visual result: no iOS letterboxing, no obvious clipping, no tab-bar overlap on reviewed first-view screens. Discover remains the densest screen but now shows the first result fully and the second result partially on iPhone 16e.
- Ran full test suite:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

- Result: 20 tests, 0 failures.
- Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.01_15-29-13--0700.xcresult`.
- Remaining local caveat: `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has the unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted unless Joe asks.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - M2 Interaction Punch List

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `0d861f0`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: finish the M2 acceptance punch list Joe approved: Discover keyboard swipe dismissal, basic Map search, Discover places section with an embedded 3-stage `my`/`friends`/`everyone` switch, and Profile people section with the same 3-stage switch for `following`/`followers`/`friends`.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/DesignSystem/WanderTheme.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Profile/ProfileScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/DiscoverModels.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `WanderTests/WanderStoreTests.swift`
- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- Joe added Map selected-place details feedback mid-pass.
- Discover:
  - Added `.scrollDismissesKeyboard(.interactively)`.
  - Moved source scope into the Places section as a 3-way `mine` / `friends` / `everyone` segmented switch.
  - Default Discover scope is now `everyone` under current follow/privacy visibility rules.
- Profile:
  - Reworked the people section into a 3-way `following` / `followers` / `friends` switch with inline rows.
- Map:
  - Added local search over visible place name/category/locality/owner/note/rating.
  - Removed the custom marker title pill so MapKit's outside annotation title is the only place label.
  - Changed selected place sheet expansion from tap-on-handle to vertical swipe/drag.
  - Added expanded sheet answer/detail chips from current local fixture fields because M2 does not yet persist Add-flow `LocalPlaceAttribute` answers.
- During final verification, found a transient dirty typo in `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift` (`_initialPresentation` name mangled). Restored it to committed content; no RootView diff remains.
- Tests:
  - Initial sandboxed `xcodebuild test` could not access CoreSimulator; reran with approved elevated simulator access.
  - Final command: `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
  - Result: 22 tests, 0 failures.
  - Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.02_12-56-11--0700.xcresult`.
- No screenshots captured for this pass; Joe said he would test and wanted push/merge first.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - Persist Add Question Answers

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `eba2c70`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: wire Add-flow contextual question answers into `LocalPlaceAttribute`, show those persisted answers in the expanded Map place sheet, commit/push, then continue into M3 backend foundation.

Current question source:

- Code currently has starter blocks: `how's the vibe?`, `good for working?`, and `tags`.
- Spec defines category templates but does not enumerate all options. Implementing starter category-aware templates now:
  - Coffee: rating, work setup, coffee tags.
  - Hike: rating, strenuousness, hike tags.
  - Restaurant: rating, price, occasion, restaurant tags.
  - Bar/park/default: rating plus lightweight category tags.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Add/AddScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Models/LocalModels.swift`
- `Wander/Services/RepositoryProtocols.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderFixtures.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `WanderTests/WanderStoreTests.swift`
- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion checkpoint:

- Added category-aware Add question templates while keeping answer persistence open-ended for future custom/user-created questions.
  - Coffee: rating/excitement, work setup, tags.
  - Hike: rating/excitement, strenuousness, tags.
  - Restaurant: rating/excitement, price, occasion, tags.
  - Bar/park/default: rating/excitement plus lightweight category tags.
- Added `PlaceAttributeDraft` and store-level `placeAttributes` state.
- `saveCandidate` now accepts optional answer attributes:
  - Add details passes attributes and persists them.
  - Existing callers that omit attributes preserve existing answers instead of wiping them.
  - Explicitly provided attributes replace the old answer set for that saved place.
- Seeded Woodcat, Griffith, and Larchmont with real `LocalPlaceAttribute` rows.
- Expanded Map place sheet now reads persisted attributes instead of category-derived placeholder chips.
- Social saves copy source place attributes into the saved place.
- `pendingSyncCount` now includes unsynced attributes.
- Locked the flexible-answer/custom-question decision in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Tests:
  - First run failed on a missing `return` in `saveVisiblePlace` after adding copied attributes; fixed.
  - Final command: `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
  - Result: 24 tests, 0 failures.
  - Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.02_13-12-47--0700.xcresult`.
- No screenshots captured for this pass.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - M3 Supabase Foundation

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `d0f624c`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: start M3 backend foundation with Supabase schema/RLS/RPC contract artifacts before wiring iOS Clerk UI. Include question-definition support so future user-created/custom questions can be added without changing answer columns.

Environment note:

- `supabase` CLI is not installed locally.
- `psql` is not installed locally.
- I can write migration and SQL policy test files, but cannot execute them in this environment until a Supabase/Postgres runner is available.

Expected files to touch:

- `supabase/migrations/20260602131500_m3_foundation.sql`
- `supabase/tests/rls_visibility.sql`
- `docs/backend/m3-supabase-foundation.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`
- `docs/decisions.md` if M3 backend decisions need to be locked.

Checkpoint:

- Added first M3 migration under `supabase/migrations/`.
- Added pgTAP-style RLS visibility tests under `supabase/tests/`.
- Verified current official Clerk/Supabase docs: native Clerk Supabase integration uses Clerk session tokens, `role=authenticated`, and RLS can read the Clerk user id from `auth.jwt()->>'sub'`.
- Added explicit `question_definitions` support for future user-created questions/inputs:
  - System starter prompts are global.
  - User custom prompts are owner-authored.
  - Attached custom prompt metadata becomes readable only through visible place attributes.
  - Answers stay JSON-backed in `place_attributes`; do not add hardcoded answer columns for new prompts.
- Tightened profile/map RPCs so they return joined place rows with attributes, not raw `user_places` rows.
- Removed authenticated client update access for canonical `places`; future reconciliation should use service-role backend code.
- Added `docs/backend/m3-supabase-foundation.md`.
- Updated `docs/decisions.md` and `docs/open-questions.md` for Clerk `sub` mapping and M3 test-runner status.

## 2026-06-01 - Codex - Discover People Rail Fix

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `89988a0`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has an unstaged local signing/team diff containing `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Y7TVK75RZ8`, generated app file type churn, and target-attribute cleanup. Treat as unrelated unless Joe explicitly wants signing metadata committed.

Goal: update Discover's people rail so it starts with an add-person affordance and only shows users who are actually on Wander. Non-Wander contact rows should not appear in the people rail.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `WanderTests/WanderStoreTests.swift` or related tests if store behavior needs coverage
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion checkpoint:

- Changed `WanderStore.contactMatches()` to exclude contacts without a matched Wander `userID`, so non-Wander contacts are not shown in social rails.
- Updated Discover people rail to show a fixed add-person card to the left of the horizontal people scroll. Tapping it seeds username search with `@` and focuses the search field.
- Deduplicated Discover profile search results against matched contact user IDs, so Maya does not appear twice when also returned from username search.
- Visual QA screenshots:
  - `DerivedData/visual-sweep/after-discover-add-rail-iphone16plus.png`
  - `DerivedData/visual-sweep/after-discover-add-rail-iphone16e.png`
- Tests: `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: 21 tests, 0 failures.
- Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.01_17-06-34--0700.xcresult`.
- Remaining local caveat: `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has the unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted unless Joe asks.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - Map Filter Label Alternatives

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `7d58068`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain untouched.

Goal: quickly mock alternate active/inactive treatments for the Map filter/label chips because the current selected state is not clear enough. Produce a reviewable HTML/PNG artifact, not production SwiftUI changes yet.

Expected files to touch:

- `preview/map-filter-label-alts/index.html`
- `preview/map-filter-label-alts/map-filter-label-alts.png` if rendering succeeds
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Checkpoint:

- Joe clarified this should be a focused color/border state study, not full phone mocks.
- Added focused artifact: `preview/map-filter-label-alts/states.html`.
- Rendered PNG: `preview/map-filter-label-alts/map-filter-state-options.png`.
- Recommendation in the mock: Option 2, active = white fill + terracotta ring/check, inactive = faded bone fill + muted border/hollow icon.

## 2026-06-02 - Codex - M2 Visual Acceptance Pass

Agent: Codex
Branch: `main`
Starting commit: `7d58068`
Starting status: local `main` matches `origin/main`; `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` has the same unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff. Existing uncommitted work includes the map filter state mock artifacts and this log.

Goal: implement Joe's approved M2 visual feedback before M3: map filter active ring states, place labels on map, selected/tapped pin state, selected place expanded screen for Larchmont Noodles, facepile/social proof instead of "`Name`'s tip", simpler screen titles, Profile organization cleanup, and Discover hierarchy with places above filters plus my/friends place toggle.

Expected files to touch:

- `Wander/Features/Map/MapScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Discover/DiscoverScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Profile/ProfileScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Features/Settings/SettingsScreen.swift`
- `Wander/Services/WanderLocalStore.swift`
- `Wander/Services/DiscoverModels.swift`
- `Wander/App/WanderRootView.swift` only if QA launch support needs a selected map state
- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/agent-log.md`

Completion checkpoint:

- Locked M2 visual decisions in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Map:
  - Active filters now keep the bone/sand chip fill and add a terracotta ring/icon.
  - Removed the `friends` map filter chip per Joe; map scope now shows `you`, `social`, `been`, `wanna`.
  - Added vertical padding to the chip rail so active outlines do not clip.
  - Added map place labels and selected/tapped pin styling.
  - Added expandable selected place sheet and QA launch args for Larchmont Noodles.
  - Replaced "`Name`'s tip" with facepile/social proof copy like "Ryan saved it".
- Discover:
  - Simplified title to `discover`.
  - People section stays near the top under search.
  - Places are the primary content above filters.
  - Added `my places` / `friends' places` toggle and matching store scope.
- Profile:
  - Simplified title to `profile`.
  - Removed bio quote from the owner header.
  - Moved following/followers/friends into a lower `people` section.
- Settings:
  - Simplified title to `settings`.
- Tests: `xcodebuild test -project Wander.xcodeproj -scheme Wander -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus,OS=18.6' -derivedDataPath DerivedData CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Result: 22 tests, 0 failures.
- Latest passing result bundle: `DerivedData/Logs/Test/Test-Wander-2026.06.02_11-08-03--0700.xcresult`.
- Visual screenshots captured before final Joe stop:
  - `DerivedData/visual-sweep/m2-visual-acceptance-map-larchmont-expanded-iphone16plus.png`
  - `DerivedData/visual-sweep/m2-visual-acceptance-discover-iphone16plus.png`
  - `DerivedData/visual-sweep/m2-visual-acceptance-profile-iphone16plus.png`
  - `DerivedData/visual-sweep/m2-visual-acceptance-settings-iphone16plus.png`
- Remaining local caveat: `Wander.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` still has the unrelated unstaged local signing/team diff and should remain uncommitted unless Joe asks.
